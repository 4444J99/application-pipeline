# Signal Map

Which framings and blocks correlate with success. Updated from conversion-log.yaml analysis.

*No data yet — will be populated by `scripts/conversion_report.py` after outcomes accumulate.*

## Framework

| Signal | Metric | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Identity position effectiveness | Acceptance rate by position | conversion-log.yaml |
| Block usage patterns | Which blocks appear in successful submissions | conversion-log.yaml |
| Track conversion rates | Success rate by track (grant/residency/job/etc.) | conversion-log.yaml |
| Framing-target fit | Which framings match which target types | conversion-log.yaml |
| Time-to-response | Average days to hear back by track | conversion-log.yaml |
