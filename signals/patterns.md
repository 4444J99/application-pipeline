## Deadline Pressure

| Window | Entries | Nearest |
|--------|---------|---------|
| This week | 0 | — |
| Next 2 weeks (by 3/13) | 1 | PEN America (3/16, deferred→3/1) |
| Next month (by 3/27) | 2 | Google Creative Fellowship (3/18) |
| Next 2 months (by 4/27) | 7 | Fire Island, Headlands, NLNet (4/1) |

## Key Observations

1. **Volume achieved, conversion not yet tested.** 60 submissions in 4 days is high throughput. The pipeline infrastructure is working. Zero positive outcomes yet — but submissions are only 1-3 days old. Too early for signal.

2. **Follow-up system now activated.** 41 entries have follow-up fields populated. 38 actions due today (Day 1-3 window for LinkedIn connections). This is the next conversion lever.

3. **Job track dominates.** 43/78 entries (55%) are job applications. All to tech companies. The independent-engineer position is the workhorse.

4. **Grant/residency pipeline has hard deadlines.** 7 drafting entries with deadlines between 3/18 and 5/1 need attention now.

5. **12 withdrawals already.** These were strategic (India on-site requirements, expired postings) — not failures. But the withdrawal rate (20% of outcomes) suggests tighter pre-qualification could help.

## Hypotheses to Test

1. Does the systems-artist framing convert better than creative-technologist for grants?
2. Does the 60s block or the 2min block earn more interview callbacks?
3. Do applications with tailored resumes outperform base-resume submissions?
4. Which portal type (Greenhouse vs Ashby vs custom) has highest response rate?
5. Do hand-written cover letters outperform alchemized versions?
6. Does follow-up outreach within Day 1-2 window improve response rates?
7. At what point do high-volume submission bursts show diminishing returns?
