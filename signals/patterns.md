# Conversion Patterns

Emerging patterns from submission outcomes. Updated as data accumulates.

*No data yet — patterns will emerge after 10+ submissions with tracked outcomes.*

## Hypotheses to Test

1. Does the systems-artist framing convert better than creative-technologist for grants?
2. Does the 60s block or the 2min block earn more interview callbacks?
3. Do applications with benefits-cliff notes affect acceptance rates?
4. Which project descriptions (organvm-system vs. recursive-engine vs. generative-music) generate the most interest?
5. Do hand-written cover letters outperform composed-from-blocks versions?
