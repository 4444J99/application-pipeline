### 1. Anthropic Forward Deployed Engineer

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | `anthropic-fde` |
| **Organization** | Anthropic |
| **Score** | 5.5 |
| **Application URL** | [https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/anthropic/jobs/5074695008](https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/anthropic/jobs/5074695008) |
| **Resume (PDF)** | `materials/resumes/anthropic-fde-resume.pdf` |
| **Resume (HTML)** | `materials/resumes/anthropic-fde-resume.html` |
| **Cover Letter** | `variants/cover-letters/anthropic-fde-custom-agents.md` |
| **Greenhouse Answers** | `scripts/.greenhouse-answers/anthropic-fde.yaml` |
| **Portfolio URL** | https://4444j99.github.io/portfolio/ |

**Framing:** Independent engineer with AI systems infrastructure experience and 11 years teaching experience as customer-facing communication evidence.

**Greenhouse Answers Status:** 11 FILL IN placeholders remaining -- NOT ready for API submission. Must complete answers before submitting.

**Notes:**
Salary range $280,000-$400,000. PRIORITY: Tier 4 -- Deprioritize. "Forward-deployed" means customer-facing enterprise engineering -- building custom solutions for enterprise customers on-site. Core gap (no enterprise customer-facing tech experience) is structural, not frameable. Teaching shows communication but not enterprise deployment context. High strategic value (8) is tempting but probability too low -- effort better spent on SE Claude Code application.

| **Greenhouse Answers** | `scripts/.greenhouse-answers/runway-mts.yaml` |
| **Portfolio URL** | https://4444j99.github.io/portfolio/ |

**Framing:** Independent engineer building research tooling infrastructure -- 21K code files, 94 CI/CD pipelines, creative-AI systems bridging art and production.

**Greenhouse Answers Status:** 0 FILL IN placeholders -- ready for API submission.

**Notes:**
Salary range $240,000-$290,000. PRIORITY: Tier 3 -- Apply If Time Permits (submit fifth). Score is 5.7 (second highest), but role leans toward ML research infrastructure more than systems engineering.

The DX role values someone who makes complex systems understandable. Gap to bridge: "Lead" implies team management experience, which is missing.

### 7. Cohere Applied AI Engineer, Agentic Workflows

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|

| **Greenhouse Answers** | N/A (Ashby portal) |
| **Portfolio URL** | https://4444j99.github.io/portfolio/ |

**Framing:** Independent engineer with agentic workflow infrastructure -- agentic-titan (1,095 tests), multi-agent orchestration, 94 CI/CD pipelines.

**Notes:**
Salary undisclosed. PRIORITY: Tier 2 -- Apply with Targeted Narrative (submit third). Agentic workflows match agentic-titan directly. Multi-agent orchestration, 1,095 tests, 18 development phases -- exact domain match. Gap to bridge: Track record at 4 is modest. No enterprise deployment of agentic systems.

| **Portfolio URL** | https://4444j99.github.io/portfolio/ |

**Framing:** Independent engineer and developer advocate -- 810K+ words documentation, 42 essays, 11 years teaching, open-source infrastructure at scale.

**Notes:**
Salary range $120,000-$160,000. PRIORITY: Tier 1 -- Apply Now (submit second). Role where the full body of work is evidence. 42 essays (810K+ words) = sustained technical writing. 11 years teaching 2,000+ students = proven communication. 103 public repos = open-source at scale. Dev advocacy is the intersection of engineering + communication + community -- all three demonstrated strengths. Honest gaps: Limited ML knowledge (but dev advocacy doesn't require training models). No prior dev advocate title (but teaching IS advocacy).

**Special:** Portal field requires a writing sample in addition to resume and cover letter.

### 16. OpenAI Software Engineer, Applied Evals

| **Greenhouse Answers** | N/A (Custom portal) |
| **Portfolio URL** | https://4444j99.github.io/portfolio/ |

**Framing:** Independent engineer with testing infrastructure expertise -- 3.6K test files, 85% coverage on flagships, evaluation-adjacent methodology.

**Notes:**
Salary range $230,000-$385,000. PRIORITY: Tier 4 -- Deprioritize. Applied evals is a specialized ML discipline. Testing infrastructure (3.6K test files, 85% coverage) is evaluation-adjacent but not evaluation work. Limited ML knowledge (acknowledged in covenant-ark Section J) is a hard gap. Lowest mission alignment and strategic value of the job group.

### Greenhouse API Submission (alternative to manual portal)

For the 5 Greenhouse entries with completed answer files, you can submit directly via API instead of the web portal:

```bash
# Dry-run first to preview
python scripts/greenhouse_submit.py --target cloudflare-models-engineer-developer-relations
python scripts/greenhouse_submit.py --target figma-software-engineer-developer-experience
python scripts/greenhouse_submit.py --target runway-mts
python scripts/greenhouse_submit.py --target stripe-full-stack-engineer-developer-experience-product-platform
python scripts/greenhouse_submit.py --target together-ai

# Then submit (adds --submit flag)
python scripts/greenhouse_submit.py --target cloudflare-models-engineer-developer-relations --submit
python scripts/greenhouse_submit.py --target figma-software-engineer-developer-experience --submit
python scripts/greenhouse_submit.py --target runway-mts --submit
python scripts/greenhouse_submit.py --target stripe-full-stack-engineer-developer-experience-product-platform --submit
python scripts/greenhouse_submit.py --target together-ai --submit
```

**Note:** `anthropic-fde` is excluded from API submission until its 11 FILL IN placeholders are completed. Run `python scripts/greenhouse_submit.py --check-answers --batch` to verify answer completeness.

### Post-Submission Verification

After recording all submissions, verify the pipeline state:

```bash
python scripts/pipeline_status.py
python scripts/velocity.py --update-signals
```

All 16 entries should show `status: submitted` with today's date in `timeline.submitted`.
