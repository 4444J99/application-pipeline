Detailed version: `organvm-corpvs-testamentvm/docs/applications/10-funding-strategy.md`

## Benefits Cliff Summary

**Current situation:** Single adult, NYC, ~$12K adjunct base, receiving SNAP + Medicaid + Fair Fares.

| Program | Threshold | Grant Treatment | Risk |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|------|
| SNAP | $20,352/yr (130% FPL) | Lump-sum grants EXCLUDED (BBCE) | SAFE |
| Medicaid | $21,597/yr (138% FPL) | Taxable grants count toward MAGI | Moderate above ~$9.6K |
| Essential Plan | $39,125/yr (250% FPL) | Same as Medicaid, $0 premium bridge | Low |
| Fair Fares | $22,692/yr (145% FPL) | Counts toward annual income | Hard cliff (~$700-800/yr) |

**Safe grant-stacking ceiling:** ~$9K-$12K/year in one-time grants (on $12K adjunct base) preserves ALL benefits. With Schedule C deductions, gross ceiling rises to ~$11K-$14K.

**Key rule:** Call NYLAG (212-613-5000) before accepting any single grant >$5K.

## Track Priorities

1. **Art-Tech Grants & Residencies** — Highest fit (6-9/10). Primary track.
2. **Emergency & Rolling Funds** — No deadlines, activate immediately.
3. **Writing Income** — Pitch immediately, $250-$3K per piece.
4. **Selective Employment** — Only high-fit roles (6/10+). Competitive reaches.
5. **Consulting & Freelance** — Build pipeline through outreach. $100-125/hr.
6. **Career-Building** — 3-12 month horizon. Institutional credibility.

## Decision Rules

- Apply to everything with fit score >= 7/10 and compatible deadline
- Deprioritize anything requiring relocation unless fully funded (Tulsa, ZKM)
- Check benefits cliff before accepting any offer > $5K
- Use systems-artist position for art grants, creative-technologist for tech
- Never lead with cathedral depth — always storefront first
