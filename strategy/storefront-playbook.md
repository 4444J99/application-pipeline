# Storefront Playbook: Cathedral → Storefront Translation

## The Insight

Grant reviewers read 200 applications in an afternoon. Hiring managers spend 30 seconds on a resume. The first 60 seconds determine whether anyone reads further.

The cathedral — 101 repos, 42 essays, 410K+ words, 33 sprints — is the substance. But substance without a storefront is invisible.

## Translation Rules

### Rule 1: Lead with the Number, Not the Concept

**Cathedral:** "I design environments where creative organisms grow — and then I document the process of growing them."

**Storefront:** "101 repositories across 8 organizations, built and documented by one person using AI as a compositional instrument."

*Why:* Numbers are scannable. Concepts require attention the reviewer hasn't committed yet.

### Rule 2: One Sentence, One Claim

**Cathedral:** "The system is simultaneously: (a) working infrastructure that produces creative work, (b) a documented methodology for solo production at institutional scale, (c) an argument that the process of creation — made visible and governable — is itself the most interesting thing an artist can produce, and (d) a reusable model other practitioners can learn from."

**Storefront:** "A 101-repository creative system that treats governance as its primary artistic medium."

*Why:* Multiple claims dilute each other at scanning speed. Pick the one that fits the target.

### Rule 3: Match the Reviewer's Vocabulary

| If they ask about... | Say... | Not... |
|---------------------|--------|--------|
| "Your practice" | "systems art" | "creative infrastructure" |
| "Innovation" | "AI-augmented solo production at institutional scale" | "AI-conductor model" |
| "Community impact" | "100% public documentation, reusable governance patterns" | "radical transparency" |
| "Technical approach" | "automated governance, dependency validation, CI/CD" | "promotion state machine" |

### Rule 4: Storefront First, Cathedral on Request

Structure every submission:
1. **Opening line** — The hook (storefront)
2. **Evidence paragraph** — Key metrics (storefront)
3. **Depth paragraph** — Methodology and meaning (cathedral entrance)
4. **Links** — Portfolio, essays, system hub (cathedral)

The reviewer who scans gets the hook and metrics. The reviewer who reads gets the methodology. The reviewer who clicks gets the cathedral.

### Rule 5: Different Storefronts for Different Streets

The same work needs different storefronts:

| Audience | Storefront lead |
|----------|----------------|
| Art grant panel | "Governance IS the artwork — 101 repos as a living creative system" |
| Tech fellowship | "Production-grade AI orchestration: 2,349 tests, automated governance, zero violations" |
| Writing grant | "42 essays, 142K words documenting the process of building creative infrastructure" |
| Emergency fund | "Housing-precarious NYC artist with 5+ years sustained creative practice" |

## The 60-Second Test

Before submitting anything, apply this test:

1. Read only the first paragraph. Does it communicate who you are and what you've built?
2. Can a reviewer explain your application to a colleague in one sentence after reading for 60 seconds?
3. Is the most impressive metric visible without scrolling?

If any answer is no, rewrite the storefront layer.
