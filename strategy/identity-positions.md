# Identity Positions

Four framings of the same body of work for different audiences. Derived from covenant-ark Section H.

## Rules

- **Never** say "I am an engineer" or "software engineer" — use "systems artist," "creative technologist," or "auteur-producer"
- **Never** frame the system as a portfolio piece for an engineering job — the system IS the creative practice
- The process of creation IS the product — this is the thesis, not a metaphor
- "Solo production at institutional scale" is the method descriptor
- "AI tools as compositional instruments" is the technology descriptor

## 1. Systems Artist

**For:** Art grants, residencies, prizes
**Narrative:** "I build creative systems — the governance IS the artwork"
**Evidence:** 100-repo eight-organ system as living creative work, 42 essays, MFA
**Targets:** Creative Capital, Artadia, FCA, NYSCA/NYFA, Eyebeam, Fire Island, Headlands, Prix Ars, S+T+ARTS, ZKM, LACMA

**Opening line template:**
> I am a systems artist who builds creative infrastructure at institutional scale. The ORGANVM project — 100 repositories coordinated across 8 GitHub organizations through automated governance — is simultaneously working infrastructure and an argument that the process of creation, made visible and governable, is itself the most interesting thing an artist can produce.

## 2. Educator

**For:** Education grants, fellowships, academic positions
**Narrative:** "Teaching complex systems to diverse audiences IS my creative practice"
**Evidence:** 100+ courses, 2,000+ students, 8+ institutions, 11 years
**Targets:** Spencer Foundation, NEH, Bread Loaf, state arts councils, university partnerships

**Opening line template:**
> With 11 years of college instruction across 8+ institutions and 2,000+ students, I have built a teaching practice grounded in making complex systems accessible. The eight-organ system I've documented in 42 published essays demonstrates this methodology applied to creative infrastructure.

## 3. Creative Technologist

**For:** Tech grants, selective roles, accelerators, consulting
**Narrative:** "Production-grade AI orchestration with creative-artistic applications"
**Evidence:** Multi-agent orchestration, autonomous governance, 2,349+ tests, 82+ CI/CD workflows
**Targets:** Google Creative Lab, Processing Foundation, consulting clients, Together AI, HuggingFace

**Opening line template:**
> I build production-grade AI orchestration systems. The ORGANVM project coordinates 100 repositories through automated dependency validation, a formal promotion state machine, and 82+ CI/CD pipelines — all designed, tested (2,349+ tests), and documented by a single practitioner using AI tools as compositional instruments.

## 4. Community Practitioner

**For:** LGBTQ+ funding, identity-specific grants, housing-related funding, community programs
**Narrative:** "Building creative infrastructure from lived experience of precarity"
**Evidence:** LGBTQ+, housing-precarious, recovery-informed practice, ORGAN-VI community repos
**Targets:** Queer|Art, Fire Island, TJFP, Lambda Literary, WFF Housing Stability, PEN America, Stimpunks

**Opening line template:**
> As a queer, housing-precarious artist building creative infrastructure from lived experience of precarity, I understand that the systems we build reflect the conditions we build them in. The eight-organ system — including its community infrastructure (ORGAN-VI) and public documentation of 42 essays — was built as a model for sustainable creative practice accessible to others navigating similar circumstances.
