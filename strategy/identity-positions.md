# Identity Positions

Five framings of the same body of work for different audiences. Derived from covenant-ark Section H.

## Rules

- **Never** say "I am an engineer" or "software engineer" in art/grant contexts — use "systems artist," "creative technologist," or "auteur-producer"
- **Exception:** For job-track applications at AI labs, use "independent engineer" or "systems engineer" framing (see Position #5)
- **Never** frame the system as a portfolio piece for an engineering job in grant contexts — the system IS the creative practice
- The process of creation IS the product — this is the thesis, not a metaphor
- "Solo production at institutional scale" is the method descriptor
- "AI tools as compositional instruments" is the technology descriptor

## 1. Systems Artist

**For:** Art grants, residencies, prizes
**Narrative:** "I build creative systems — the governance IS the artwork"
**Evidence:** 103-repo eight-organ system as living creative work, 42 essays, MFA
**Targets:** Creative Capital, Artadia, FCA, NYSCA/NYFA, Eyebeam, Fire Island, Headlands, Prix Ars, S+T+ARTS, ZKM, LACMA

**Opening line template:**
> I am a systems artist who builds creative infrastructure at institutional scale. The ORGANVM project — 103 repositories coordinated across 8 GitHub organizations through automated governance — is simultaneously working infrastructure and an argument that the process of creation, made visible and governable, is itself the most interesting thing an artist can produce.

## 2. Educator

**For:** Education grants, fellowships, academic positions
**Narrative:** "Teaching complex systems to diverse audiences IS my creative practice"
**Evidence:** 100+ courses, 2,000+ students, 8+ institutions, 11 years
**Targets:** Spencer Foundation, NEH, Bread Loaf, state arts councils, university partnerships

**Opening line template:**
> With 11 years of college instruction across 8+ institutions and 2,000+ students, I have built a teaching practice grounded in making complex systems accessible. The eight-organ system I've documented in 42 published essays demonstrates this methodology applied to creative infrastructure.

---

## 3. Creative Technologist

**For:** Tech grants, selective roles, accelerators, consulting
**Narrative:** "Production-grade AI orchestration with creative-artistic applications"
**Evidence:** Multi-agent orchestration, autonomous governance, 2,349+ tests, 94+ CI/CD workflows
**Targets:** Google Creative Lab, Processing Foundation, consulting clients, Together AI, HuggingFace

**Opening line template:**
> I build production-grade AI orchestration systems. The ORGANVM project coordinates 103 repositories through automated dependency validation, a formal promotion state machine, and 94+ CI/CD pipelines — all designed, tested (2,349+ tests), and documented by a single practitioner using AI tools as compositional instruments.

## 4. Community Practitioner

**For:** LGBTQ+ funding, identity-specific grants, housing-related funding, community programs
**Narrative:** "Building creative infrastructure from lived experience of precarity"
**Evidence:** LGBTQ+, housing-precarious, recovery-informed practice, ORGAN-VI community repos
**Targets:** Queer|Art, Fire Island, TJFP, Lambda Literary, WFF Housing Stability, PEN America, Stimpunks

**Opening line template:**
> As a queer, housing-precarious artist building creative infrastructure from lived experience of precarity, I understand that the systems we build reflect the conditions we build them in. The eight-organ system — including its community infrastructure (ORGAN-VI) and public documentation of 42 essays — was built as a model for sustainable creative practice accessible to others navigating similar circumstances.

---

## 5. Independent Engineer

**For:** AI lab engineering roles, developer tooling positions, infrastructure engineering
**Narrative:** "5 years building production-grade Python/TypeScript infrastructure at scale — 103 repos, 21K code files, 3.6K tests, 94 CI/CD pipelines, governance as architecture"
**Evidence:** system-metrics.json (computed, verifiable), agentic-titan (1,095 tests), recursive-engine (1,254 tests, 85% coverage), 43 validated dependency edges, 0 violations, automated governance
**What to emphasize:** Testing discipline, CI/CD, systems architecture, API orchestration, documentation rigor, autonomous governance design
**What to acknowledge:** Independent practice (no team PRs), no production users, LLM API orchestration not ML training
**Targets:** Anthropic, OpenAI, Runway, Together AI, Cohere, HuggingFace

**Opening line template:**
> 21,160 code files. 3,610 test files across 70 repositories. 94 CI/CD pipelines. 43 validated dependency edges with zero violations — all designed, built, and maintained by a single practitioner. This is not freelance consulting or contract work: it is sustained independent production at engineering-team scale, five years of Python and TypeScript across 103 repositories coordinated through 8 GitHub organizations.

**Pattern interrupt:** Lead with the output scale before naming the solo context. The reviewer's "contractor" pattern fires on "solo practitioner" — delay that phrase until after the numbers have established the scale.

**What to say about solo work:** "Independent practice — not consulting, not contract work. Sustained production at the scale of a small engineering team, without institutional support."

## Extended Framings

The four canonical positions above cover most applications. The following target-specific framings extend them for specialized contexts. Each maps to a canonical parent position.

| Extended Framing | Parent Position | Block File | Use For |
|-----------------|----------------|------------|---------|
| AI Orchestrator | Creative Technologist | `framings/ai-orchestrator.md` | AI-specific grants, tech roles emphasizing the AI-conductor methodology |
| Emergency / Precarity | Community Practitioner | `framings/emergency-precarity.md` | Emergency funds, housing stability grants — tone is direct, factual, not embellished |
| S+T+ARTS European Dimension | Systems Artist | `framings/starts-prize-european-dimension.md` | Prix Ars Electronica, S+T+ARTS — EU governance parallels, media art lineage |
| S+T+ARTS Art-Tech Collaboration | Creative Technologist | `framings/starts-prize-art-tech-collaboration.md` | S+T+ARTS — bridge between artistic vision and technical infrastructure |

**Rule:** Use the canonical position as the primary framing. Use an extended framing only when the target explicitly calls for the specialized angle (e.g., "European dimension" requirement in S+T+ARTS, or emergency fund applications requiring documentation of need).
