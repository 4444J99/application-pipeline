## Conversion Funnel Approach

### Variables Being Tracked
- **Channel:** direct (all current), referral (target), linkedin (avoid as primary)
- **Resume variant:** per-role tailored PDFs via alchemize.py
- **Cover letter:** concise pitch in Additional Info (never merged with resume PDF)
- **Custom answers:** Greenhouse/Ashby portal question quality
- **Follow-up:** LinkedIn connect Day 1-2, DM Day 7-10, final Day 14-21

### Conversion Targets
| Stage | Target Rate | Benchmark |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Apply → Response | 10% | Industry cold: 5-10% |
| Response → Interview | 33% | |
| Interview → Offer | 33% | |
| Full funnel (cold) | 1% | |
| Full funnel (with follow-up) | 5% | |

### Daily Volume
- **Target:** 3-5 tailored applications per day
- **Evidence:** 3-5 tailored/day → 20-30% interview conversion; 10+ generic/day → 2-4%
- **Sweet spot:** 21-80 total applications

### Daily Workflow
1. **Morning (1hr):** Run `standup.py`, check `followup.py`, send LinkedIn DMs
2. **Core block (3-4hr):** Submit 3-5 applications
3. **End of day (30min):** Run `pipeline_status.py`, update conversion log, source 2-3 new roles

## Channel Strategy

| Channel | Response Rate | Recommendation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Referral + direct | Highest | Seek for Tier 1 targets |
| Company career page (cold) | 2-5% | Current approach — keep, supplement with follow-up |
| Indeed | 20-25% | Not using — consider for broader reach |
| LinkedIn Easy Apply | 3-13% | AVOID as primary — low signal |

**Multi-channel approach:** Apply via direct link + simultaneously find hiring manager on LinkedIn.
For top-tier targets (Anthropic, Perplexity, Figma): seek employee referrals (8x hire rate).

## Follow-Up Protocol

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Day 0 | Submit application |
| Day 1-2 | Connect with hiring manager/recruiter on LinkedIn |
| Day 7-10 | First follow-up: short DM referencing application |
| Day 14-21 | Second and final follow-up |
| After that | Move on |
