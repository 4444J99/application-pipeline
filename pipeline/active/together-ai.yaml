notes: |
  Salary range $160,000-$240,000.
  PRIORITY: Tier 2 — Apply with Targeted Narrative (submit fourth).
  DX + documentation is a real strength. 810K+ words, 100% README coverage, 42 essays.
  The DX role values someone who makes complex systems understandable — that's what the
  essays and teaching demonstrate.
  Gap to bridge: "Lead" implies team management experience, which is missing.
