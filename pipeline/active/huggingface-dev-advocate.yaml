notes: |
  Salary range $120,000-$160,000.
  PRIORITY: Tier 1 — Apply Now (submit second). Role where the full body of work is evidence.
  42 essays (810K+ words) = sustained technical writing. 11 years teaching 2,000+ students
  = proven communication. 103 public repos = open-source at scale. Dev advocacy is the
  intersection of engineering + communication + community — all three demonstrated strengths.
  Honest gaps: Limited ML knowledge (but dev advocacy doesn't require training models).
  No prior dev advocate title (but teaching IS advocacy).
