  Salary range $280,000-$400,000.
  PRIORITY: Tier 4 — Deprioritize. "Forward-deployed" means customer-facing enterprise
  engineering — building custom solutions for enterprise customers on-site. Core gap (no
  enterprise customer-facing tech experience) is structural, not frameable. Teaching shows
  communication but not enterprise deployment context. High strategic value (8) is tempting
  but probability too low — effort better spent on SE Claude Code application.
