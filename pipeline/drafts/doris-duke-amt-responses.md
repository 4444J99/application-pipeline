## Concept Description (250 words max)

> Clearly describe your big idea. What is your project intended to address? How does the project engage new perspectives or approaches to the performing arts through the use of technology?

What if the formal rules that coordinate software could also coordinate live performers?

This project builds a performance score engine that translates software governance protocols into structured improvisation scores for dancers, musicians, and theater artists. I have spent five years building a documented creative-institutional system — 101 software repositories across 8 organizations, coordinated through dependency validation, a promotion state machine, and automated governance workflows. These governance rules are formal constraints: which components may depend on others, how work advances through stages, when coordination interventions trigger. They are structurally identical to the generative constraints that composers and choreographers have always used — counterpoint rules, chance operations, movement grammars.

The six-month prototyping period will produce three outputs:

1. **Performance Score Engine** — open-source software translating the system's governance rules (dependency graphs, no-back-edge constraints, promotion protocols) into real-time scores for live performers. The rules that currently coordinate code become the rules coordinating bodies, voices, and media.

2. **Three Proof-of-Performance Workshops** — collaborative sessions with performing artists testing the engine. Each workshop uses a different governance rule as its primary compositional constraint, developed with dancers, musicians, and theater practitioners recruited through NYC's performing arts community.

3. **Open-Source Methodology** — the translation methodology, all three performance scores, and process documentation published openly, consistent with the project's existing practice of radical transparency (42 published essays, 410,000+ words of public documentation).

The project creates reusable tools for performing artists to engage governance structures as creative material — proving that institutional architecture and live performance share a common formal language.

## Feasibility (100 words max)

> What are some challenges you anticipate when implementing your idea or approach, and how do you plan to mitigate these challenges?

The primary challenge is translation fidelity: ensuring governance rules produce scores that are artistically generative, not merely mechanical. I will mitigate this through iterative workshops with performing artists, treating each session as a feedback loop refining the translation methodology. Performer recruitment is addressed through NYC's performing arts networks and the $30,000 collaborator budget. The technical foundation exists — the governance infrastructure is operational, documented, and tested. The risk is not whether the rules can be formalized (they already are) but whether performers find them productive. The workshop structure makes that discovery the central activity.

## Field Survey (100 words max)

> Are you aware of other individuals or organizations working on similar ideas? If yes, explain how your work complements that of others or fills a gap.

Artists and technologists have long created performance scores from formal systems — from Merce Cunningham's chance-based choreography to Mimi Yin's choreographic interfaces at NYU ITP to live-coding performance communities using algorithmic composition. My work fills a specific gap: translating *institutional governance rules* — the formal protocols that coordinate organizations — into performance material. Existing tools generate scores from mathematical, musical, or movement abstractions. No existing practice treats the operational rules of creative institutions themselves as compositional source material. The project bridges organizational design and performance-making in a way the field has not yet explored.

## Field Impact (100 words max)

> How does this project impact the performing arts field? How do you plan on evaluating the impact of the project?

The project produces open-source tools and a documented methodology that performing artists can adapt to their own institutional contexts — any organization with formal governance rules gains a new pathway into performance-making. Impact evaluation will measure: (1) whether performing artists find the governance-to-score translations artistically productive, assessed through structured post-workshop feedback; (2) adoption of the open-source tools by other practitioners; (3) documentation reach, building on the existing 42-essay public process practice. The methodology itself becomes field infrastructure — a replicable process for converting organizational architecture into live art.

## About You (150 words max per person, 300 words max total)

> Please provide background on your work and, if applicable, describe a previous project that demonstrates your approach to, and engagement with, new digital tools, innovative data practices, or production methods.

Systems artist, writer, and creative technologist based in NYC. MFA in Creative Writing (FAU, 2015–2018). 11 years teaching at 8+ institutions, 2,000+ students. 18 years professional experience spanning creative systems design, education, multimedia production, and project management. LGBTQ+.

The project demonstrating my approach is the eight-organ creative-institutional system: 101 software repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, built and documented over 5+ years as a single-practitioner infrastructure coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing. The system uses automated governance workflows — CI/CD pipelines validating dependency rules, a formal promotion state machine advancing repositories through lifecycle stages, cross-organization event coordination — as both production infrastructure and creative medium.

I use AI tools as compositional instruments: directing generation, sequencing outputs, applying editorial judgment — analogous to a conductor directing an orchestra, where the creative intelligence is architectural. The system's 42 published essays (~142,000 words), 33 named development sprints, and 82+ automation pipelines document this methodology in real time. The process of building the system IS the primary creative output.
