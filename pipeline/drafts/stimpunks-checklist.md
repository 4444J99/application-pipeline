[ ] PROJECT DESCRIPTION
    The eight-organ system grows from lived experience of precarity — housing instability, recovery, the specific vulnerability of building a creative practice without institutional support. ORGAN-VI (Community) and ORGAN-V (Public Process) exist because creative infrastructure should be visible, shared, and governed by the people it serves. 42 published essays document this practice transparently, including the failures.
    Stimpunks Creator Grant represents a critical opportunity to sustain and extend this practice. The work is built, documented, and operational — what it needs now is the time and resources to deepen, not to start over.
