[ ] PROJECT DESCRIPTION
    This project develops a performance-making framework that translates software governance protocols into live performance scores — proving that the same formal rules that coordinate 97 software repositories can generate, structure, and sustain collaborative performing arts work.
    The eight-organ creative-institutional system is a documented infrastructure I've built over 5+ years, coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public documentation, community programming, and distribution across 100 repositories and 8 organizations. The system's governance model — dependency validation, promotion state machines, automated coordination workflows — currently operates as software infrastructure. This project asks: what happens when those rules become choreographic?
    The proposed six-month rapid prototyping period will produce three interconnected outputs:
    1. **Performance Score Engine** — A software tool that translates the organ system's governance rules (dependency graphs, no-back-edge constraints, promotion protocols) into structured improvisation scores for live performers. The rules that currently coordinate code repositories become the rules that coordinate bodies, voices, and media in real time.
    2. **Three Proof-of-Performance Works** — Staged readings / workshop performances testing the score engine with dancers, musicians, and theater artists. Each performance uses a different governance rule as its primary constraint.
    3. **Open-Source Documentation** — The performance score engine, the governance-to-choreography translation methodology, and all three performance scores published as open-source tools other performing artists can adapt. Consistent with the project's existing practice of radical transparency (42 published essays, 404,000+ words of public documentation).
    The project bridges AI-augmented systems design and live performance, creating reusable tools for performing artists to engage with governance structures as creative material.
