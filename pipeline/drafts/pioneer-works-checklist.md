[ ] ARTIST STATEMENT
    I build creative systems — the governance IS the artwork.
    My practice centers on the eight-organ system — a documented infrastructure coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing across 100 repositories and 8 GitHub organizations. The 42 published essays documenting this process aren't reflections on the work; they ARE the work — the creative process rendered into prose in real time.
    I use AI tools as compositional instruments, the way Brian Eno treated the studio. The architectural vision, governance design, and editorial judgment are the creative work. The result: a documented methodology for solo production at institutional scale, built over 5+ years and 33 development sprints.

[ ] PROJECT DESCRIPTION
    The eight-organ system is a living creative work — 100 repositories across 8 organizations coordinated through automated governance, a formal promotion state machine, and 42 published essays documenting the process in real time. The governance structures aren't bureaucracy — they're generative constraints, the way a composer's harmonic rules shape what melodies can emerge.
    A residency at Pioneer Works Residency would provide the focused time and creative community to advance the most challenging next phase of this work — moving from documented infrastructure to active community engagement and public presentation.
