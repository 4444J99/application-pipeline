[ ] PROJECT DESCRIPTION (target: ~300 words)
    The eight-organ system is a living creative work — 100 repositories across 8 organizations coordinated through automated governance, a formal promotion state machine, and 42 published essays documenting the process in real time. The governance structures aren't bureaucracy — they're generative constraints, the way a composer's harmonic rules shape what melodies can emerge.
    Awesome Foundation NYC represents a critical opportunity to sustain and extend this practice. The work is built, documented, and operational — what it needs now is the time and resources to deepen, not to start over.
