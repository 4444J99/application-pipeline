Nexus Babel Alexandria is a living digital canon that atomizes literary works to their molecular level — glyph-seeds carrying phonemic, historic, and thematic metadata — enabling creative recombination, temporal evolution, and multilingual scholarly exploration. The name encodes three commitments: Nexus (connection across traditions), Babel (insistence that language technology must work for Yoruba and Welsh and Tagalog, not just English), Alexandria (preservation of the full complexity of human linguistic expression).

The system's core innovation is a 9-layer bidirectional hypergraph architecture that treats language not as a pipeline but as a web of simultaneous participations — every word exists at once in token, morphological, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, discourse, sociolinguistic, rhetorical, and semiotic layers. This framework synthesizes four theoretical traditions: category theory (DisCoCat compositional semantics), Peircean semiotics, Aristotelian rhetoric, and Kittler's media archaeology. 84 formally specified core functions operate across these layers.

The canon-building capabilities make the system a creative instrument, not just an analytical one. Texts can be atomized into glyph-seeds (the smallest meaningful units), then recombined through four remix strategies: interleave, thematic blend, temporal layer, and glyph collide. Branch timelines let a text drift through centuries of simulated linguistic change — deterministic, replayable, forkable. The temporal evolution engine models natural drift, synthetic mutation, and phase shifts (expansion, peak, compression, rebirth).

Dual-mode governance addresses responsible AI directly: PUBLIC mode applies content filtering; RAW mode provides full research access with flagging and audit trails. This isn't an afterthought — it's architectural, encoded in the API's permission model.

The working MVP includes a FastAPI REST API (25+ endpoints), ingestion pipeline, governance evaluation, hypergraph integrity verification, and comprehensive test suite. Open-source. Built by a single practitioner using AI tools as compositional instruments within a 101-repository creative system.

## AI Disclosure

AI tools used as compositional instruments for specification drafting and code scaffolding. The 9-layer architecture, category-theoretic framework, synthesis of four theoretical traditions, governance design, and all conceptual decisions are human. The 50,000-word specification was authored by the artist; AI assisted with prose generation and code implementation within that framework.
