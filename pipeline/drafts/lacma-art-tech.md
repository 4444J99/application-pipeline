## Project Description

# Project: The ORGANVM Eight-Organ System

## One-Line
101-repository creative system coordinated across 8 GitHub organizations through automated governance.

## Short (100 words)
The ORGANVM system coordinates 101 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations — spanning theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing. A machine-readable registry serves as single source of truth. Automated dependency validation enforces architectural rules (no circular dependencies, no back-edges). A formal promotion state machine governs how work moves between organs. 82+ CI/CD pipelines, 2,349+ tests, 33 development sprints, and ~404K+ words of documentation — all built by a single practitioner using AI tools as compositional instruments.

## Full
The eight-organ system coordinates:

- **ORGAN-I (Theoria):** 20 repos — epistemology, recursion, ontology
- **ORGAN-II (Poiesis):** 30 repos — generative art, performance, experiential systems
- **ORGAN-III (Ergon):** 27 repos — SaaS products, B2B/B2C tools
- **ORGAN-IV (Taxis):** 7 repos — orchestration, governance, AI agents
- **ORGAN-V (Logos):** 2 repos — public process essays, building in public
- **ORGAN-VI (Koinonia):** 4 repos — community infrastructure, salons
- **ORGAN-VII (Kerygma):** 4 repos — POSSE distribution, marketing
- **META-ORGANVM:** 7 repos — cross-system governance, registry, dashboard

Key infrastructure: `registry-v2.json` as single source of truth, `governance-rules.json` encoding constitutional principles, automated dependency validation (31 edges, 0 violations), promotion state machine (LOCAL → CANDIDATE → PUBLIC_PROCESS → GRADUATED → ARCHIVED), 5 GitHub Actions workflows for autonomous governance.

## Artist Statement

# Identity: 5-Minute Statement

101 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations. 42 published essays. 410,000+ words of public documentation. 2,349+ automated tests. All built by one person.

That scale invites a fair question: *why solo?* The answer is structural, not temperamental. The eight-organ system — coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing — required a single architectural vision sustained across every boundary. Committees produce compromise; this project required coherence. The same logic that makes a film director a director, not a committee chair, applies here: someone has to hold the whole design in their head for the parts to cohere.

The project is called ORGANVM, and it treats governance as a creative medium. The registry that tracks all 101 repositories is a machine-readable constitution. The dependency graph — theory feeds art, art feeds commerce, never the reverse — is an architectural constraint as deliberately chosen as any compositional rule. The promotion state machine that governs how work moves between organs is both working infrastructure and an argument about how creative systems should be organized.

I use AI tools the way Brian Eno used the recording studio: as compositional instruments, not replacements for creative judgment. The AI-conductor model — human directs architecture, AI generates volume, human reviews — enabled one person to produce at institutional scale. The methodology is documented transparently in the 42 essays, including failures and course corrections. This isn't a portfolio of finished works; it's a working demonstration that the process of creation, made visible, is itself the creative output.

The practical evidence: a recursive symbolic engine with 1,254 tests and a custom DSL. A multi-agent orchestration framework with 1,095 tests across 18 development phases. An interactive identity platform with 291 tests and 44 database tables. 82+ CI/CD pipelines. Zero dependency violations across 31 validated edges. These aren't prototypes — they're production-grade systems built to the standard of infrastructure that other people depend on, even though right now the only person depending on them is me.

My background spans 11 years of college instruction across 8+ institutions and 2,000+ students, 15 years of multimedia production, and formal training in both creative writing (MFA, FAU) and full-stack development (Meta, Google certifications). The eight-organ system is where all of these converge: the pedagogical instinct to make complex systems legible, the production discipline to ship, and the creative ambition to treat the whole enterprise as an artwork.

What I'm building is simultaneously working infrastructure, a documented methodology, and an argument that the most interesting thing an artist can produce is a visible, governable creative process.
