[ ] PROJECT DESCRIPTION
    The eight-organ system is a living creative work — 100 repositories across 8 organizations coordinated through automated governance, a formal promotion state machine, and 42 published essays documenting the process in real time. The governance structures aren't bureaucracy — they're generative constraints, the way a composer's harmonic rules shape what melodies can emerge.
    A residency at Eyebeam Speculating on Plurality would provide the focused time and creative community to advance the most challenging next phase of this work — moving from documented infrastructure to active community engagement and public presentation.
