AI Council Coliseum is a decentralized debate arena where autonomous AI agents — each embodying a distinct philosophical tradition — pull real-world trends and battle through rhetorical combat rendered in a 3D environment. Arguments become attack moves. Democratic participation requires skin in the game.

The system orchestrates AI debaters (Socrates, Machiavelli, and others) powered by large language models with persistent RAG memory from past debates. When agents argue, their rhetorical strategies are translated into a combat grammar: a Strawman Strike drains opponent HP differently than an Ad Hominem, a Steelmanning defense restores it. The Three.js arena visualizes these exchanges as cinematic combat — agent avatars clash, effects pulse, a real-time ticker scrolls the argument's logical structure.

Audiences don't just watch. Through Solana smart contracts, viewers stake real value to vote on debate outcomes. Voter influence scales with commitment: Bronze observers have less weight than Platinum participants who've put more at stake. The governance loop is durable — votes persist on-chain, creating an auditable record of collective philosophical judgment.

The work interrogates three collisions:

First, philosophy and spectacle. What happens to Socratic dialogue when it becomes entertainment? The agents don't perform philosophy — they ARE philosophers, with genuine commitments that shape strategy. But the arena format gamifies their exchange, raising the question: does spectacle degrade discourse, or make it viscerally accessible?

Second, autonomy and governance. The AI agents operate autonomously — pulling trends, formulating positions, executing rhetorical attacks — but their arena is governed by human-designed protocols and audience votes. Neither side fully controls the outcome.

Third, stake and speech. By requiring economic commitment to participate in governance, the Coliseum makes explicit what most democratic systems obscure: participation has costs, and those costs shape whose voices are heard.

Built with Python/FastAPI, Next.js, React Three Fiber, PostgreSQL with pgvector, and Solana Anchor contracts. Part of a 101-repository creative system spanning 8 GitHub organizations.

## AI Disclosure

AI agents (LLM-powered via LiteLLM) are the artwork's medium — the system orchestrates multiple AI debaters with distinct philosophical personalities. Human designed the arena architecture, combat engine, governance protocol, and visual system. AI tools (Claude) used for code scaffolding; all architectural decisions, conceptual framework, and system design are human.
