[ ] PROJECT DESCRIPTION
    The eight-organ system coordinates 100 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations through automated governance: 82+ CI/CD workflows, 31 dependency edges with zero violations, a formal promotion state machine, and 2,349+ automated tests across the flagship frameworks (agentic-titan: 1,095 tests, recursive-engine: 1,254 tests). Built using the AI-conductor methodology — AI generates volume, human directs architecture.
    Google Artists + Machine Intelligence Grants represents a critical opportunity to sustain and extend this practice. The work is built, documented, and operational — what it needs now is the time and resources to deepen, not to start over.
