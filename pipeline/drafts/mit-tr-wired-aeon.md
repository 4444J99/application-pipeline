## 3-4 Paragraph Pitch

Dear editors,

I'm writing to pitch a feature on the emerging practice of AI-augmented creative production at institutional scale — told through the concrete case study of one person who used AI orchestration tools to build and govern a 101-repository creative system across 8 GitHub organizations, and what that five-year experiment reveals about the real economics of human-AI collaboration.

The project is called ORGANVM. It coordinates theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing through automated dependency validation, a formal promotion state machine, and 82+ CI/CD pipelines. The 2,349+ automated tests, 410,000+ words of public documentation, and 33 named development sprints were all produced by a single practitioner using AI tools as compositional instruments — the way Brian Eno treated the recording studio, not the way a content farm treats GPT. The 42 published essays documenting the process include honest accounting of failures, course corrections, and the actual labor dynamics: "AI-augmented" turns out to mean the human does more cognitive work, not less, because the bottleneck shifts from production to judgment.

This isn't a think piece about AI. It's a practitioner's report from inside a working system, with verifiable evidence (every repository, test, pipeline, and essay is public). The proposed essay (3,000-5,000 words) offers readers something rare in the AI discourse: a documented, longitudinal case study of what actually changes when creative practice is reorganized around AI orchestration tools.

I hold an MFA in Creative Writing (Florida Atlantic University), Meta Full-Stack Developer and Google certifications, and have 18 years of professional experience across creative systems design, college instruction (11 years, 2,000+ students), and multimedia production. I'm happy to tailor the pitch to your publication's specific editorial focus.

Best,
Anthony James Padavano
