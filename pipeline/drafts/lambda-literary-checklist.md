[ ] ARTIST STATEMENT
    Building creative infrastructure from lived experience of precarity.
    My practice centers on the eight-organ system — a documented infrastructure coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing across 100 repositories and 8 GitHub organizations. The 42 published essays documenting this process aren't reflections on the work; they ARE the work — the creative process rendered into prose in real time.
    I use AI tools as compositional instruments, the way Brian Eno treated the studio. The architectural vision, governance design, and editorial judgment are the creative work. The result: a documented methodology for solo production at institutional scale, built over 5+ years and 33 development sprints.
