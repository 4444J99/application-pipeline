[ ] PROJECT DESCRIPTION
    # Project: The ORGANVM Eight-Organ System
    
    ## One-Line
    101-repository creative system coordinated across 8 GitHub organizations through automated governance.
    
    ## Short (100 words)
    The ORGANVM system coordinates 101 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations — spanning theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing. A machine-readable registry serves as single source of truth. Automated dependency validation enforces architectural rules (no circular dependencies, no back-edges). A formal promotion state machine governs how work moves between organs. 82+ CI/CD pipelines, 2,349+ tests, 33 development sprints, and ~404K+ words of documentation — all built by a single practitioner using AI tools as compositional instruments.
    
    ## Full
    The eight-organ system coordinates:
    
    - **ORGAN-I (Theoria):** 20 repos — epistemology, recursion, ontology
    - **ORGAN-II (Poiesis):** 30 repos — generative art, performance, experiential systems
    - **ORGAN-III (Ergon):** 27 repos — SaaS products, B2B/B2C tools
    - **ORGAN-IV (Taxis):** 7 repos — orchestration, governance, AI agents
    - **ORGAN-V (Logos):** 2 repos — public process essays, building in public
    - **ORGAN-VI (Koinonia):** 4 repos — community infrastructure, salons
    - **ORGAN-VII (Kerygma):** 4 repos — POSSE distribution, marketing
    - **META-ORGANVM:** 7 repos — cross-system governance, registry, dashboard
    
    Key infrastructure: `registry-v2.json` as single source of truth, `governance-rules.json` encoding constitutional principles, automated dependency validation (31 edges, 0 violations), promotion state machine (LOCAL → CANDIDATE → PUBLIC_PROCESS → GRADUATED → ARCHIVED), 5 GitHub Actions workflows for autonomous governance.
