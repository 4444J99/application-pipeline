notes: |
  Salary range $320,000-$560,000.
  PRIORITY: Tier 1 — Apply Now (submit first). Highest fit by wide margin (6.3).
  CLI developer tools and agentic systems built daily — this pipeline, alchemize.py,
  greenhouse_submit.py, the entire scripts/ directory IS the kind of work this role does.
  Evidence that lands: 21K code files, 3.6K tests, 94 CI/CD pipelines, agentic-titan (1,095 tests).
  Honest gaps: No team engineering, no production users. Scale and testing discipline are real.
