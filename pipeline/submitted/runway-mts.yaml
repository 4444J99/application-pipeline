  Salary range $240,000-$290,000.
  PRIORITY: Tier 3 — Apply If Time Permits (submit fifth).
  Score is 5.7 (second highest), but role leans toward ML research infrastructure more than
  systems engineering. Creative-AI bridge via ORGAN-II is real, but role likely needs more
  hands-on ML pipeline experience. Good application, lower probability of advancing past screen.
