notes: |
  GivingData form differs significantly from legacy script assumptions.
  5 short-answer text fields (concept 250w, feasibility 100w, field_survey 100w,
  field_impact 100w, about_you 150w). 11 budget line items. 2 PDF attachments only
  (resume + work samples combined). Submissions are FINAL upon upload. Noon deadline,
  not midnight. ~750 applicants expected → 40 finalists → 20 grantees.
  Technician FAQ: articulate why work is good match for theater/dance/jazz.
  DDF mandate prioritizes dance/jazz/theater — "Other" discipline applicants
  remain eligible but not prioritized. Mozilla side more open to cross-disciplinary.
