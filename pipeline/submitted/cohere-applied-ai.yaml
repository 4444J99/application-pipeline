  Salary undisclosed.
  PRIORITY: Tier 2 — Apply with Targeted Narrative (submit third).
  Agentic workflows match agentic-titan directly. Multi-agent orchestration, 1,095 tests,
  18 development phases — exact domain match. Role title says "agentic workflows" and
  agentic-titan IS an agentic workflow framework.
  Gap to bridge: Track record at 4 is modest. No enterprise deployment of agentic systems.
