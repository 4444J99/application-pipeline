notes: |
  Salary range $230,000-$385,000.
  PRIORITY: Tier 4 — Deprioritize. Applied evals is a specialized ML discipline. Testing
  infrastructure (3.6K test files, 85% coverage) is evaluation-adjacent but not evaluation
  work. Limited ML knowledge (acknowledged in covenant-ark Section J) is a hard gap. Lowest
  mission alignment and strategic value of the job group. Effort better redirected to Tier 1-2.
