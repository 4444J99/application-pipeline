# Identity: 2-Minute Statement

I build creative systems — environments where theory, art, and community work grow like organisms in a medium. My eight-organ system coordinates 100 repositories across 8 organizations through automated governance, dependency validation, and a formal promotion state machine. The 42 published essays documenting this process aren't reflections on the work; they ARE the work — the creative process rendered into prose in real time.

I use AI tools as compositional instruments, the way Brian Eno treated the studio or Hundred Rabbits treat their custom toolchain. The architectural vision, governance design, and editorial judgment are the creative work; AI provides execution capacity. The governance rules aren't bureaucracy — they're generative constraints that shape what the system can become.

The result: a documented methodology for solo production at institutional scale, built over 5+ years and 33 named development sprints, demonstrating that process-as-product is a viable and rigorous creative practice.
