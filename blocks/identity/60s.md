# Identity: 60-Second Pitch

103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, built, tested, and documented by a single practitioner. The architecture — a formal promotion state machine, 43 validated dependency edges, and 94 CI/CD pipelines — is the artwork: governance made visible, steerable, and human-readable. AI is the compositional instrument; the process of creation is the product.
