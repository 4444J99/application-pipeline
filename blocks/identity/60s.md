# Identity: 60-Second Pitch

103 repositories across 8 organizations, built and documented by one person. My eight-organ system coordinates theory, generative art, commerce, governance, public process, community, and marketing through automated governance and a formal promotion state machine. 42 published essays document the methodology in real time.

Solo production using AI tools as compositional instruments.
