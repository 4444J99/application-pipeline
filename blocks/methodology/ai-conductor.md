# Methodology: AI-Conductor Model

## One-Line
Human directs architecture; AI generates volume; human reviews and refines.

## Short (150 words)
The AI-conductor model treats AI tools as compositional instruments — the way Brian Eno treated the recording studio or Brian Wilson directed session musicians. The human practitioner provides architectural vision, governance design, and editorial judgment. AI provides execution capacity at scale.

This methodology enabled a single operator to build, document, and validate 103 repositories across 8 organizations — demonstrating that the creative intelligence lies in the architecture and the editorial judgment, not in any single line of code or prose. Effort is measured in LLM API tokens, not human-hours: a 3,000-word README requires ~72K tokens across generation, revision, and validation passes.

The model is documented transparently in 42 published essays. It's reusable: other practitioners can adopt the same approach to achieve institutional-scale output as independent creators.

## Key Metric
~810K+ words of documentation produced by one person using this methodology.
