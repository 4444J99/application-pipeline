# Methodology: Governance as Creative Medium

## One-Line
Registry design, dependency graphs, and promotion pipelines as generative artistic structures.

## Short (150 words)
The eight-organ system treats governance as a creative medium. The rules that coordinate 103 repositories — dependency validation, promotion state machines, constitutional constraints — are designed with the same care as any artistic output. They're generative constraints: the way a composer's harmonic rules shape what melodies can emerge.

`governance-rules.json` encodes constitutional principles. The dependency validator enforces that theory feeds art feeds commerce — never the reverse. Monthly audits confirm system health. The constraints hold because they're structural, not procedural.

This approach draws from Julian Oliver's critical engineering (technology's hidden social agency), Nicky Case's Explorable Explanations (interactive systems that teach), and Hundred Rabbits' radical transparency (tool-making as creative practice). What connects all of them: the conviction that protocols, governance structures, and systems design are primary creative outputs.
