# Pitch: Gay & Lesbian Review

Dear Editors,

I'm writing to pitch a personal essay for the Gay & Lesbian Review on queer creative infrastructure — what it looks like to build sustainable artistic practice from conditions of precarity, and why the systems we design under constraint often end up more resilient than those designed in comfort.

Over the past five years, I've built an eight-organ creative system: 101 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, and public process through automated infrastructure. The 42 essays documenting this process in real time are the primary creative output — not reflections on the work, but the work itself. I built this as a queer, housing-precarious artist, and the essay I'm proposing would examine how that lived experience shaped the architecture: why I designed community infrastructure (reading groups, salons, mutual learning) as a core organ rather than an afterthought, and what it means to treat creative governance as a form of mutual aid.

The proposed essay (2,500-4,000 words) draws on adrienne maree brown's emergent strategy and Dean Spade's mutual aid frameworks to argue that queer creative practitioners are already building the institutional alternatives the art world claims to want — we're just building them at a scale and in a register that existing institutions don't recognize. I hold an MFA in Creative Writing from Florida Atlantic University and have 11 years of college instruction across 8+ institutions.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss this further. A writing sample from my public process documentation is available at https://organvm-v-logos.github.io/public-process/.

Best,
Anthony James Padavano
