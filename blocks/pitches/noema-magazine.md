# Pitch: Noema Magazine

Dear Noema editors,

I'd like to pitch a long-form essay on governance as creative medium — what happens when an artist treats the organizational infrastructure of creative practice not as administrative overhead, but as the primary artwork. Over five years, I've built an eight-organ creative system: 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, coordinated through a machine-readable registry, automated dependency validation, and a formal promotion state machine. The constitutional principles encoded in the governance rules aren't metaphorical — they're executable code that shapes what the system can and cannot produce. The 42 published essays documenting this experiment are the primary creative output: the process of building, governing, and amending a creative institution rendered into prose in real time.

The essay I'm proposing (3,000-5,000 words) would use this project as a case study to explore a larger argument: that the most interesting design problems of the next decade aren't about what to make, but about how to govern what gets made. It sits at the intersection of institutional design, computational governance, and artistic practice — drawing on the logic of constitutionalism, the aesthetics of systems art, and the practical reality of maintaining complex infrastructure as a solo practitioner using AI tools as compositional instruments. I hold an MFA in Creative Writing from Florida Atlantic University and have published 809,812+ words of public process documentation.

A writing sample from my public process essays is available at https://organvm-v-logos.github.io/public-process/.

Best,
Anthony James Padavano
