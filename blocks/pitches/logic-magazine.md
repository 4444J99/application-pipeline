# Pitch: Logic Magazine

Dear Logic editors,

I'd like to pitch a feature essay on what happens when one person applies AI orchestration tools not to optimize a business, but to build and govern a creative practice at institutional scale — and what that experiment reveals about the actual labor dynamics of human-AI collaboration.

Over five years, I've built a system called ORGANVM: 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, coordinated through automated dependency validation, a formal promotion state machine, and 82+ CI/CD pipelines. I use AI tools as compositional instruments — the way Brian Eno used the recording studio — where the human directs architecture, AI generates volume, and the human reviews. The 42 published essays documenting this process include honest accounting of what the AI-conductor model actually costs in attention, judgment, and editorial labor. The headline number (2,349+ automated tests, 810,000+ words of documentation) obscures the more interesting story: that "AI-augmented" solo practice is still overwhelmingly human labor, just reorganized.

The proposed essay (3,000-5,000 words) would examine the political economy of AI-augmented creative labor through this concrete case study — not as futurism or manifesto, but as a practitioner's report from inside the machine. I hold an MFA in Creative Writing and have 18 years of professional experience spanning creative systems, college instruction, and multimedia production.

A writing sample from my public process essays is available at https://organvm-v-logos.github.io/public-process/, and I'm happy to provide additional clips.

Best,
Anthony James Padavano
