# Evidence: Key Differentiators

1. **Solo production at institutional scale.** One person built and documented a 100-repository system across 8 organizations with automated governance, dependency validation, and a formal promotion state machine — the kind of infrastructure normally requiring a team of 5-10.

2. **Process-as-product methodology.** The 42 essays aren't marketing or documentation — they ARE the creative work. The visible record of building the system, including mistakes and course corrections, is the primary artistic output.

3. **AI-augmented creative practice, not AI-generated art.** AI tools serve as compositional instruments — the architectural vision, governance design, and editorial judgment are human. This is the Eno model applied to software.

4. **Governance as creative medium.** Registry design, dependency graphs, promotion pipelines, and constitutional constraints are treated as generative structures — the way a composer's harmonic rules shape what melodies can emerge.

5. **Radical transparency at system scale.** Every decision, sprint, failure, and course correction is documented and published. 410K+ words, 33 sprint specs, 12 ADRs, a constitution with amendments.

6. **Cross-domain integration.** The eight-organ model bridges theory, art, commerce, governance, public process, community, and marketing. Most practitioners work in one domain; this system treats the boundaries between domains as creative sites.
