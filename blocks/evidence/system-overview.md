# Evidence: System Overview

The ORGANVM eight-organ system coordinates 101 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations. Each organ governs a domain — from epistemological theory (ORGAN-I) through generative art (ORGAN-II), commercial products (ORGAN-III), orchestration governance (ORGAN-IV), public documentation (ORGAN-V), community infrastructure (ORGAN-VI), marketing distribution (ORGAN-VII), to meta-system governance (META).

The system operates on an AI-conductor model: AI generates volume, human directs architecture and reviews output. This methodology enabled a single operator to build, document, and validate 101 repositories — demonstrating production-grade systems thinking at scale.
