# Project: Agentic Titan

## One-Line
Multi-agent orchestration framework with 1,095 tests across 18 development phases.

## Short (100 words)
Agentic Titan is a multi-agent orchestration framework that coordinates AI agents through message passing, task distribution, and fault tolerance patterns. Built through 18 development phases with 1,095 tests, it demonstrates production-grade systems thinking applied to autonomous agent coordination. The framework handles agent lifecycle management, inter-agent communication, and graceful degradation — the same governance patterns that coordinate the eight-organ system, applied to AI agent swarms.
