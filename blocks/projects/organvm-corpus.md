# Project: The authoritative planning and governance corpus for the eight-organ creative...

## One-Line
The authoritative planning and governance corpus for the eight-organ creative-institutional system.

## Short (100 words)
The authoritative planning and governance corpus for the eight-organ creative-institutional system. 81 repos, ~339K words, 8 organizations, 21 essays. This is not a source code repository. It is the authoritative planning and governance corpus for the organvm system — a framework that protects distinct modes of work (theory, art, commerce, community) from collapsing into each other, while presenting the meta-system itself as a portfolio asset. The system launched on 2026-02-11 with all 8 organs operational, 97 repositories, ~404K+ words of documentation, 42 meta-system essays, and automated governance via GitHub Actions. Part of META-ORGANVM (Meta).

**Document Architecture:** The corpus is organized in layers, each building on the previous: ``` Layer 0: Genesis (docs/genesis/) 00-a (Q&A transcript) → 00-b (local/remote structure) → 00-c (master summary) → 00-d (system audit) Layer 1: Phase 1 Planning (docs/planning/) 01 (scoring rubric) → 02 (inventory) → 03 (templates) → 04 (checklists) → 05 (risk map) Layer 2: Execution & Strategy (docs/strategy/) phase-1-execution-index → parallel-launch-strategy → roadmap-there-and-back-again Layer 3: v2 Active Documents (docs/implementation/) implementation-package-v2 → orchestration-system-v2 → public-process-map-v2 → registry-v2.json → github-actions-spec Layer 4: Evaluation & Cross-Validation (docs/evaluation/) 06 (evaluation) → 07 (prompts + results) → 08 (canonical action plan) → 09 (corpus coherence review) Layer 5: Standards & Configuration (docs/standards/ + .config/) 10-repository-standards → 11-specification-driven-development → organvm.env → organvm.config.json Archive: v1 predecessors (docs/archive/, frozen, superseded by v2) ``` The full cross-document dependency map and per-file annotations are in [`ANNOTATED-MANIFEST.md`](docs/ANNOTATED-MANIFEST.md). For a concise directory map, see [`DIRECTORY.md`](DIRECTORY.md). ---

**Why This System Exists:** The eight-organ system began with a question: what happens when you apply the same rigor to organizing creative work that engineers apply to organizing code? Most creative portfolios are flat — a list of projects with screenshots and descriptions. The relationships between projects are implicit, the governance is invisible, and the organizational logic is whatever the creator happened to do most recently. This system takes a different approach. The relationships between projects are explicit (declared dependencies in the registry), the governance is visible (promotion state machines, validation scripts, constitutional articles), and the organizational logic is itself a designed artifact (eight organs with distinct responsibilities and no back-edges). The meta-system isn't overhead on top of the creative work — it *is* the creative work, or at least the most interesting part of it. The practical consequence is that this portfolio can answer questions that flat portfolios cannot: How do theory projects relate to commercial products? (Through declared dependency edges.) How do you maintain quality across 103 repos? (Through automated validation and documented standards.) How do you prevent different types of work from corrupting each other? (Through organ-level separation with GitHub organizations as the enforcement boundary.) How was ~404K+ words of documentation produced in nine days? (Through
