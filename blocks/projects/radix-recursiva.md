# Project: Recursive root solving and alchemical cycles

## One-Line
Recursive root solving and alchemical cycles

## Short (100 words)
Recursive root solving and alchemical cycles. A recursive generative operating system that unifies knowledge architecture, symbolic computation, and experimental containment into a single self-documenting vault — where the specification implements itself and naming conventions encode ontological meaning. The title is an alchemical formula. Solve — dissolve the existing structure, break apart assumptions and inherited categories. Coagula — recompose what was dissolved into new, more coherent form. Redi — return to the beginning, carrying the transformation forward into the next cycle. This is not decoration.
