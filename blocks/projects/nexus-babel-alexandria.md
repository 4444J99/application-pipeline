# Project: Nexus Babel Alexandria

## One-Line
Living digital canon with 9-layer rhetorical-linguistic analysis, 50,000-word specification, and working MVP API.

## Short (100 words)
Nexus Babel Alexandria (ARC4N) is a living digital canon that atomizes literary works to their molecular level — glyph-seeds carrying phonemic, historic, and thematic metadata — enabling creative recombination, temporal evolution, and multilingual scholarly exploration. Built on the premise that Yoruba deserves the same architectural commitment as English. The 9-layer bidirectional hypergraph synthesizes category theory (DisCoCat), Peircean semiotics, Aristotelian rhetoric, and Kittler's media archaeology into 84 formally specified core functions. Dual-mode governance (PUBLIC/RAW) addresses responsible AI. Working MVP: FastAPI REST API with 25+ endpoints, ingestion pipeline, and comprehensive test suite.

## Full
Nexus Babel Alexandria treats language not as a pipeline but as a bidirectional hypergraph — every linguistic phenomenon simultaneously participates in multiple layers of meaning.

### Nine-Layer Plexus Architecture
1. **Token** — Raw character/glyph processing
2. **Morphology** — Word formation, inflection, derivation
3. **Syntax** — Grammatical structure and dependency
4. **Semantics** — Meaning, reference, composition
5. **Pragmatics** — Context, implicature, speech acts
6. **Discourse** — Coherence, topic structure, narrative
7. **Sociolinguistics** — Register, dialect, power dynamics
8. **Rhetoric** — Persuasion, argumentation, arrangement
9. **Semiotic** — Sign systems, intermediality, cultural codes

### Canon-Building Capabilities
- **5-level atomization**: Glyph-seeds → syllabic clusters → words → sentences → paragraphs
- **Temporal evolution**: Natural drift, synthetic mutation, phase shifts, glyph fusion
- **Remix engine**: Interleave, thematic blend, temporal layer, glyph collide
- **Branch timelines**: Deterministic, replayable evolution forks with seeded RNG
- **Dual-mode governance**: PUBLIC (filtered) / RAW (research access with flagging)

### Research Foundation
50,000-word specification synthesizing four theoretical traditions. 84 formally specified core functions. Seed texts from Project Gutenberg (Homer, Dante, Whitman, Joyce, Shelley). The name encodes three commitments: Nexus (connection), Babel (multilingual equity), Alexandria (cultural preservation).
