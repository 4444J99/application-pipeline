## Full
**👁️ Overview:** **CHTHON-ONEIROS** is a psychological horror narrative engine and theory corpus. It is the "Underworld" counterpart to the waking reality of Field I, exploring **horror as epistemology**—not as genre decoration, but as a mode of understanding the limits of human knowledge. The project is housed within the **PHANTASMATA** container, a registry of altered states, recursion, and reality failure. ---
