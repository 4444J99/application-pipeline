**Introduction:** This essay documents the process of building and launching an eight-organ creative-institutional system — a coordinated architecture of ~79 GitHub repositories across 8 organizations — using AI agents not as code generators but as **specialized reviewers in a cross-validation ensemble**. The conventional narrative about AI-assisted development focuses on code generation: write a prompt, get a function. This project demonstrates a different model. Four AI agents (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Copilot) were given the same planning corpus and asked to independently evaluate the system architecture, identify risks, and propose execution strategies. Their responses were then cross-validated against each other to produce a canonical action plan that no single agent — and no single human — could have produced alone. The result is not just a set of repositories. It is evidence that **AI agents can serve as an organizational simulation** — providing the diversity of perspective, constructive disagreement, and systematic review that would normally require a team of 4-6 specialists. This essay is itself an ORGAN-V artifact: a public-process document that makes the methodology visible, inspectable, and reproducible. ---

**The Eight-Organ Model:** The system organizes creative and institutional work into eight specialized organs, each with its own GitHub organization: | Organ | Domain | Organization | Function | |-------|--------|-------------|----------| | **I** | Theory | [organvm-i-theoria](https://github.com/organvm-i-theoria) | Epistemological frameworks, recursive engines, ontological systems | | **II** | Art | [organvm-ii-poiesis](https://github.com/organvm-ii-poiesis) | Generative art, performance systems, experiential computing | | **III** | Commerce | [organvm-iii-ergon](https://github.com/organvm-iii-ergon) | SaaS products, B2B tools, commercial applications | | **IV** | Orchestration | [organvm-iv-taxis](https://github.com/organvm-iv-taxis) | Multi-agent governance, routing, coordination frameworks | | **V** | Public Process | [organvm-v-logos](https://github.com/organvm-v-logos) | Essays, methodology documentation, building in public | | **VI** | Community | [organvm-vi-koinonia](https://github.com/organvm-vi-koinonia) | Salons, reading groups, collaborative encounters | | **VII** | Marketing | [organvm-vii-kerygma](https://github.com/organvm-vii-kerygma) | POSSE distribution, announcements, brand presence | | **VIII** | Meta | [meta-organvm](https://github.com/meta-organvm) | Umbrella organization coordinating all seven organs | The model enforces **unidirectional dependencies**: Theory (I) informs Art (II) which informs Commerce (III). No organ depends on a downstream organ. Orchestration (IV) coordinates across organs without creating circular dependencies. This constraint is not bureaucratic —
