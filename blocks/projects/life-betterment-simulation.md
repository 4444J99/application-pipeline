**2. Solution Overview:** ### Simulation Architecture Life Betterment Simulation is not a single application but a constellation of interconnected components, each addressing a different facet of the self-improvement-through-narrative thesis: ``` +-----------------------------------------+ | Interactive Narrative Engine | | (dating sim mechanics, choice trees, | | branching storylines, stat tracking) | +---+---------+---------+--------+--------+ | | | | v v v v +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ +--------+ |Social | |Human | |Eastern| |Guided | |Influ. | |Design | |Cosmos | |Journal | |Theory | |Sched. | |Integr.| |System | |Engine | |Mapper | |Module | | | +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ +--------+ | | | | v v v v +-----------------------------------------+ | Visualization Layer | | (Friend Zone Contagion, Spiral Anim., | | network graphs, stat dashboards) | +-----------------------------------------+ ``` **Interactive Narrative Engine** sits at the center. It manages story state, processes player choices, and coordinates with the four satellite modules: - **Social Influence Theory Engine** evaluates each choice against Cialdini's principles plus the three digital-age extensions, computing influence scores and propagating effects through the social graph. - **Human Design Schedule Mapper** takes the player's Human Design profile (type, strategy, authority, defined/undefined centers, active gates) and generates personalized scheduling recommendations that integrate with the narrative timeline. - **Eastern Cosmos Integration Module** provides philosophical context for narrative events, drawing from Buddhist impermanence, Taoist wu-wei, Vedantic self-inquiry, and Confucian relational ethics. - **Guided Journal System** produces daily prompts informed by the player's simulation choices, loosely structured after Hesse's Siddhartha -- a 30-day progression from seeking, through disillusionment, toward integration. ### Narrative Engine Design The narrative engine uses a graph-based story structure rather than a tree. Traditional dating sims present binary or ternary choices that branch into independent paths. This simulation allows paths to reconverge, creating situations where two players who made very different early choices can arrive at the same narrative moment with different internal states (different influence scores, different relationship histories, different growth stats). The consequence is that the same scene reads differently depending on how you arrived there. Story nodes carry metadata beyond their text content: required influence thresholds, relationship prerequisites, growth-stat gates, and philosophical alignment tags. A player
