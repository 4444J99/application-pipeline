## Short (100 words)
POSSE distribution backend: Mastodon, Discord, Bluesky, Ghost adapters with live/mock modes, JWT auth, delivery log, RSS poller, 75 tests. Backend automation infrastructure for POSSE content distribution -- API integrations, scheduling logic, rate limiting, retry policies, delivery monitoring, and analytics collection for the eight-organ creative-institutional system. Social Automation is the execution engine behind ORGAN-VII (Kerygma), the marketing and distribution organ of the organvm ecosystem. Where announcement-templates defines what to say and distribution-strategy defines when and to whom, this repository defines how -- the technical infrastructure that moves content from composition to delivery across every distribution channel.
