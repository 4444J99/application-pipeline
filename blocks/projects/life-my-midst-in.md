## Short (100 words)
Inverted Interview CV platform — employer-as-interviewee identity operating system with 16 masks and W3C Verifiable Credentials. A full-stack interactive CV/resume system that inverts the traditional hiring dynamic. Instead of the candidate submitting a static document and hoping for the best, the employer visits a link, answers questions about their role, team, and culture — and the system assembles a CV view curated specifically for what they are seeking. The candidate's complete professional identity is a structured, immutable ledger; what the employer sees is a dynamically filtered, role-specific snapshot assembled in real time. This is not deception.

**Product Overview:** **in–midst–my–life** reimagines the professional resume as an identity operating system. Rather than maintaining dozens of tailored PDFs or a single generic document that satisfies no one, the system maintains a single structured source of truth — a professional identity ledger — and derives audience-specific views on demand through a novel combination of mask-based filtering, role-family curation, and real-time compatibility analysis. The system is a feature-complete monorepo comprising three applications (Next.js 16 frontend, Fastify REST API, Node.js orchestrator service), four shared packages (canonical Zod schemas, core business logic, narrative content model, and a design system), backed by PostgreSQL with pgvector for semantic search and Redis for caching and task queues. **Key capabilities:** - **Inverted Interview flow** — employers answer your questions; the system evaluates mutual fit - **16 identity masks** across cognitive, expressive, and operational categories filter the same underlying truth for different professional audiences - **10 role families** map arbitrary job titles to curated mask blends, so "UI Developer" and "React Lead" produce the same optimally-configured view - **5-factor compatibility scoring** evaluates skill match, values alignment, growth fit, sustainability, and compensation against the candidate's stated preferences - **8 temporal epochs** structure career narrative from Initiation through Legacy - **W3C Verifiable Credentials** and DID resolution provide cryptographic proof of professional claims - **Hunter Protocol** autonomously searches for, analyzes, and tailors applications to matching job opportunities - **Multi-format export** to JSON-LD (semantic web), PDF (traditional resume), and Verifiable Credential packages The project is **feature-complete** with 68+ commits across all roadmap phases, zero open issues, and comprehensive test coverage via Vitest with integration test support. ---

**The Problem:** Traditional CVs are static, one-dimensional documents. They force professionals to flatten their multifaceted identity into a single narrative optimized for a single imagined reader. This creates several compounding problems: 1. **The tailoring trap.** Every new application demands a new version of the resume. The candidate maintains dozens of Word documents, each slightly different, each slightly stale, each representing a guess about what the reader wants. 2. **The identity compression problem.** A person who is simultaneously a systems architect, a creative writer, a technical lead, and a community
