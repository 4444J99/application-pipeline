# Project: life-my--midst--in

## One-Line
Interactive identity platform with 291 tests, 44 DB tables, and the Inverted Interview paradigm.

## Short (100 words)
life-my--midst--in is an interactive identity/CV platform that inverts the traditional application model. Instead of the applicant performing for the evaluator, the Inverted Interview paradigm lets visitors explore the creator's work on their own terms. Built with 291 tests, 44 database tables, and feature-complete for beta deployment, it demonstrates the ORGAN-III pipeline: theory (I) → art (II) → commercial product (III). The platform makes the eight-organ system navigable and experiential rather than documentary.
