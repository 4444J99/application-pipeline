# Project: Foundational recursive principles

## One-Line
Foundational recursive principles

## Short (100 words)
Foundational recursive principles. Multi-agent deliberation architecture that treats structured disagreement as an epistemic method — nine personality archetypes, three debate formats, swappable LLM backends, and event-driven synthesis for emergent collective intelligence. The name "A Recursive Root" points to the project's foundational claim: that intelligence recurses. A root that is recursive is a starting point that contains its own elaboration — a seed whose growth pattern is already encoded in its origin. In the Western philosophical tradition, this is anamnesis (Plato) or the self-unfolding of Geist (Hegel). In computer science, it is the fixed-point combinator.
