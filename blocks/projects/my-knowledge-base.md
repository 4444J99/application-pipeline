## Short (100 words)
Knowledge atomization system: exports Claude conversations, decomposes into semantic units with vector search and intelligence extraction. An epistemological infrastructure for converting AI conversations into durable, searchable, interconnected knowledge — with multi-modal retrieval and LLM-powered intelligence extraction. "Knowledge base" — from the Greek epistēmē (knowledge) and basis (foundation). Where conventional knowledge management systems store what you put in, this system excavates what you did not know you had: latent patterns, implicit connections, and higher-order insights buried across hundreds of AI conversation threads.

## Full
**Problem Statement:** Every meaningful AI conversation generates knowledge that evaporates. You spend ninety minutes with Claude working through a recursive data structure design, or an afternoon with Gemini prototyping a deployment strategy, and afterward that knowledge exists only inside a vendor-specific chat interface — unsearchable, unstructured, disconnected from every other conversation you have ever had. This is not a minor inconvenience. It is a structural epistemological failure. The problem decomposes into four discrete failures that existing tools do not address: **1. No export pathway.** Claude.app, Gemini, and ChatGPT offer no bulk export mechanism. Your knowledge lives behind their UIs, inaccessible to any external system. The few available export formats (ChatGPT's JSON dump, for instance) are monolithic and unprocessed — they give you raw data, not usable knowledge. **2. No atomization.** Conversations are monolithic blobs. A single session might contain a database schema discussion, a deployment decision, three code patterns, and a conceptual insight about state machines — all stored as one undifferentiated unit. Traditional note-taking tools (Notion, Obsidian, Logseq) require *you* to manually decompose conversations into discrete notes. This is precisely the labor that AI should automate. **3. No cross-conversation search.** There is no way to query across sessions, across platforms, or across time. You cannot ask "What have I learned about recursive architectures across all my Claude conversations this quarter?" Tools like Readwise, Mem, or Reflect offer search, but none ingest AI conversations natively, none atomize automatically, and none provide multi-modal retrieval that combines keyword precision with semantic understanding. **4. No intelligence extraction.** Conversations contain implicit insights — recurring themes, latent contradictions, evolving understanding — that are invisible without systematic analysis. No existing tool applies LLM intelligence to a corpus of AI conversations to surface what you did not explicitly articulate. My Knowledge Base addresses each failure with a dedicated subsystem: a multi-source export engine, a five-strategy atomizer, a three-modal search index, and an LLM-powered intelligence layer. ---

**Core Concepts:** ### 1. Knowledge Atomization The central epistemological operation is **atomization**: decomposing raw conversations and documents into the smallest self-contained units of knowledge that can stand alone, be retrieved independently, and form connections with
