## Short (100 words)
Distribution strategy brain: analytics, scheduling, persistence, report generation, Mastodon metrics pull-back, Ghost metrics pull-back, 66 tests. The strategic brain of ORGAN-VII -- audience segmentation, channel strategy, content calendar, growth targets, engagement benchmarks, and distribution philosophy for the eight-organ creative-institutional system. Distribution Strategy is the public-facing planning repository for ORGAN-VII (Kerygma), the marketing and distribution organ of the organvm ecosystem. This is where strategic intent is documented, audience segments are defined, channel performance is analyzed, and distribution decisions are made visible. It is the why and when behind every message the system sends into the world. This repository is intentionally public.
