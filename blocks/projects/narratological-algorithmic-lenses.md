## Short (100 words)
14 narratological studies × 92 algorithms — formalizing narrative principles from Aristotle to Pixar as executable code, with CLI, API, web dashboard, and real screenplay analysis. A computational engine for formalizing, analyzing, and applying narrative craft. This system transforms abstract storytelling principles—from Aristotle's Poetics to Phoebe Waller-Bridge's Fleabag—into executable algorithms that can diagnose scripts, identify structural weaknesses, and simulate "Script Doctor" consultations. Part of ORGAN-I (Theoria).

## Full
**Core Capabilities:** ### 1. The Compendium A living library of 28 formalized narrative frameworks, including: - **Classical**: Aristotle, Bharata Muni (Natyasastra), Ovid, Plato, Horace, African Oral Epic. - **Film**: Tarkovsky (Time-Pressure), Bergman (Interiority), Tarantino (Discovery Writing), Lynch (Dream Logic), Kubrick (Non-Submersible Units). - **Television**: Phoebe Waller-Bridge (Layered Obstacles), Larry David (Comedy Geometry), South Park (Therefore/But). - **Global**: Kishōtenketsu (Conflict-Agnostic), Heroine's Journey (Internal Integration). - **Interactive**: Zelda (Exploration), Final Fantasy (Ensemble). - **Comics**: Alan Moore (Formalism), Grant Morrison (Hypersigil), Kirby (Mythopoeia). - **Meta**: 8-Role Analyst System, Attention Mechanics. ### 2. Deep Diagnostics Quantitative and qualitative analysis of script structure: - **Causal Binding**: Measures the ratio of "THEREFORE/BUT" connections vs. "AND THEN" (Target > 60%). - **Reorderability**: Identifies scenes that can be moved without breaking causality (lower is better). - **Necessity**: Flags scenes that serve no structural or character function. - **Information Economy**: Detects redundant exposition and missing setups. ### 3. The Script Doctor Collaborative AI analysis that simulates a writers' room with master creators: - **Pairings**: Ask **Tarkovsky** and **Bergman** to debate your script's pacing. - **Consultations**: Get a "prescription" for your second act from **Phoebe Waller-Bridge**. - **Dialogue**: Receive feedback formatted as a philosophical debate between conflicting narrative schools. ### 4. Fountain Integration Native support for the **Fountain** screenplay format, allowing direct ingestion of professional scripts from Highland 2, Fade In, or VS Code. ### 5. Protocol Framework Seven-level skill progression (P1–P7) from `specs/08-protocol-framework/`: - **P1–P2**: Foundational awareness of narrative structure - **P3–P4**: Diagnostic application to real scripts - **P5–P6**: Multi-framework synthesis and Script Doctor facilitation - **P7**: Autonomous framework extension and study creation ---
