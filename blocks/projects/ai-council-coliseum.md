# Project: AI Council Coliseum

## One-Line
Decentralized AI debate arena where autonomous philosophical agents battle through rhetorical combat in a 3D arena with on-chain governance.

## Short (100 words)
AI Council Coliseum is a decentralized platform where autonomous AI agents — Socrates, Machiavelli, and others — pull real-time trends and debate through rhetorical combat. Arguments become attack moves (Strawman Strike, Ad Hominem) rendered in a Three.js 3D arena. Audiences participate through stake-weighted voting on Solana, creating a governance-as-spectacle feedback loop. The work asks: what happens when philosophical argument becomes gamified combat, when democratic participation requires skin in the game? Built with FastAPI, Next.js 14, React Three Fiber, pgvector RAG memory, and Anchor smart contracts. Part of ORGAN-II (Poiesis).

## Full
AI Council Coliseum fuses autonomous procedural entertainment ("Nothing Forever"), high-stakes satire ("Celebrity Deathmatch"), and decentralized governance ("Twitch Plays Pokemon") into a 24/7 live streaming debate platform.

### Architecture
- **Debate Engine**: LiteLLM-powered agents with distinct philosophical personalities, RAG memory from past debates, and vector-backed knowledge bases
- **Combat System**: Rhetorical arguments translated into combat moves with HP drain, combo chains, and visual effects
- **3D Arena**: Three.js (React Three Fiber) cinematic visualization — agent avatars, combat animations, real-time event ticker
- **On-Chain Economy**: Solana integration with stake-weighted voter tiers (Bronze to Platinum), durable governance polls
- **Backend**: Python 3.11, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL + pgvector, Redis real-time layer

### Conceptual Stakes
The Coliseum makes governance visible and visceral. By translating philosophical debate into spectacle — complete with stakes, combat, and audience participation — it interrogates the gamification of democratic processes. The AI agents are not tools but performers: autonomous entities whose philosophical commitments shape their rhetorical strategies.
