**2. Solution Overview:** ### Four Experience Pillars The platform is organized around four complementary modes of interaction, each addressing a different dimension of domestic digital life: **Pillar 1: Cozy Life Simulation.** Inspired by the design philosophy of Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley, the core gameplay loop centers on home customization, leisurely resource management, and seasonal rhythms. Players furnish rooms, tend gardens, arrange collections, and personalize their space through an extensive catalog of objects, textures, and layouts. The pacing is deliberately unhurried. There are no combat mechanics, no failure states, no competitive leaderboards. The home is a place to inhabit, not a problem to solve. **Pillar 2: Creative Sandbox.** Every object in the home can be user-created. The platform ships with a full UGC (user-generated content) creation toolkit: a 3D object editor, a texture painter, a spatial audio placement tool, and a scripting layer for interactive behaviors. Creators can publish their work to a marketplace, license it under terms they choose, and receive attribution and compensation when others use it. The creative tools are designed for accessibility -- someone who has never opened a 3D modeling program should be able to create a picture frame or a table lamp within thirty minutes. **Pillar 3: Immersive Social Hub.** Homes are visitable. When you invite a friend to your home, they enter your space as a guest -- they see your arrangements, your collections, your memorial rooms (if you grant access). Multiplayer interaction is synchronous: you can sit together, rearrange furniture collaboratively, share meals from the Intelligent Pantry, and participate in seasonal events. The social model is based on invitation and trust, not public broadcasting. You choose who enters, what they see, and how long they stay. **Pillar 4: Blended-Reality Meetup.** The platform bridges virtual and physical gathering through hybrid VR/IRL integration. A VR headset user and a phone user can occupy the same virtual space simultaneously. Physical meetup locations can be mapped into the virtual world, so a real-world book club or grief support group can have a persistent digital twin of their meeting room. AR overlays allow users to project virtual objects into physical
