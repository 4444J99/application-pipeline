# Project: Luxury real estate marketplace with blockchain verification

## One-Line
Luxury real estate marketplace with blockchain verification

## Short (100 words)
Luxury real estate marketplace with blockchain verification. An AI-powered luxury real estate analytics platform featuring augmented-reality property visualization, real-time multi-user collaboration, regulatory compliance automation, and a glassmorphism design language built for high-net-worth property management. Part of ORGAN-III (Ergon).

## Full
**Product Overview:** The luxury real estate market operates at the intersection of aspiration, regulation, and financial complexity. Agents managing portfolios worth tens of millions of dollars need tools that match the sophistication of the properties they represent — tools that are simultaneously beautiful, intelligent, and legally rigorous. The Sovereign Ecosystem was designed to fill that gap. At its core, the platform provides three primary experiences, each tailored to a distinct user role: 1. **Agent Dashboard** — A comprehensive command center for property management, market analytics, compliance monitoring, team coordination, and client relationship tools. Agents see live price feeds, pattern-based alerts, portfolio health scores, and regulatory watchlists in a single glassmorphic interface. 2. **Client Feed** — A curated, swipe-navigable property browsing experience designed for high-net-worth buyers and investors. Properties are presented as flippable cards with front-side visual presentation (live pricing, key metrics, curated badges) and back-side financial deep-dives (cap rates, ROI projections, compliance alerts, price performance sparklines). 3. **Private Vault** — A secure document management layer for deeds, inspection reports, leases, and financial records, organized by property and accessible through role-based permissions. Beyond these three views, the platform integrates an AI concierge for natural-language property search, a real-time collaboration system for multi-contractor workflows, offline-first architecture for field work in areas with poor connectivity, and an augmented-reality measurement and room-template system for spatial property analysis. The application is built entirely in TypeScript with React 19 and ships as a single-page application using Vite for bundling, Tailwind CSS v4 for styling, and the shadcn/ui component library for accessible, composable primitives. The codebase currently spans 141 files and approximately 38,000 lines of code, organized into a service-oriented architecture with clear separation between domain logic, UI components, and data hooks. ### Why "Sovereign"? The name reflects a design philosophy: each property in a luxury portfolio is treated as a sovereign entity — with its own financial profile, regulatory obligations, compliance history, and market dynamics. The platform does not flatten properties into rows in a spreadsheet. It gives each one a first-class identity with dedicated analytics, alerts, and document storage. The ecosystem metaphor extends to the relationships between
