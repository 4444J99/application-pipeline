**1. Business Problem:** ### The Market The global trading card game market surpassed $50 billion in combined primary and secondary sales in recent years, driven by sustained demand across Magic: The Gathering, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, sports cards, and newer entrants like Lorcana and One Piece TCG. This figure captures sealed product, singles, graded cards, and the grey-market speculation that surrounds chase printings, vintage staples, and limited-run promotional items. The secondary market alone -- where individual cards change hands between collectors, players, and investors -- accounts for billions in annual transaction volume across platforms like TCGPlayer, eBay, Card Kingdom, and dozens of regional marketplaces. Yet the infrastructure serving this market remains fragmented, opaque, and stuck in a paradigm designed for casual hobbyists rather than serious asset managers. Trading cards are one of the last major alternative asset classes without a unified, data-driven platform that treats price discovery, portfolio management, and community insight as first-class concerns. ### The Pain The core problems facing TCG participants today are structural, not cosmetic: - **Price fragmentation.** A single card has different prices on TCGPlayer, eBay completed listings, Card Kingdom buylist, and local game stores. There is no algorithmic "fair value" that synthesizes these signals into a single actionable number. Arbitrage opportunities exist constantly but are invisible to anyone not running custom scraping scripts. - **Portfolio blindness.** Collectors and investors with five-figure or six-figure collections have no dashboard that tracks their holdings over time, computes unrealized gains, or alerts them to sell windows. They manage inventory in spreadsheets, Moxfield decklists, or -- most commonly -- their memory. - **Community fragmentation.** Price-moving information (ban list leaks, reprint announcements, tournament results, influencer endorsements) travels through Twitter, Reddit, Discord, and YouTube. By the time a casual participant sees the signal, the price has already moved. The information asymmetry between "whales" and retail participants is enormous and growing. - **No creator economy.** Content creators who drive enormous purchasing decisions (deck techs, set reviews, market reports) have no native monetization path within the TCG ecosystem itself. They rely on YouTube ad revenue, Patreon, and affiliate links -- all external to the platforms where transactions actually
