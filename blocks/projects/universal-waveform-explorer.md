## Short (100 words)
Aether Canvas — web-based 3D modular synthesizer reframing sound design as exploration of universal vibrations via WebGL and Web Audio API. !CI !License !Organ !Status !Language A web-based, three-dimensional modular synthesizer that reframes sound design as the exploration of the universe's fundamental vibrations, inviting users to inhabit a personal celestial orrery where they discover, shape, and attune to waveform essences spanning quantum particles to heartbeats. Part of ORGAN-II (Poiesis).

**2. Solution Overview:** ### The Orrery Model The user inhabits the center of an infinite three-dimensional space — their personal celestial orrery. At the gravitational center sits the Sun, which represents the master audio output. All sound ultimately flows toward it. Around the Sun, the user places celestial bodies that generate, shape, and transform audio. The background of the entire space is a dynamic nebula that visualizes the current audio output in real time: color maps to frequency content, brightness maps to amplitude, and turbulence maps to harmonic complexity. ### Orbital Patching Traditional modular synthesizers use patch cables to create signal routes. Aether Canvas eliminates cables entirely. Instead, modulation relationships emerge from orbital mechanics: - **Proximity** determines modulation depth. A moon (LFO) orbiting close to a planet (oscillator) produces deep modulation. Pull it farther away and the modulation becomes subtle. - **Orbital speed** determines modulation rate. A fast-orbiting moon is a rapid tremolo; a slow orbit is a glacial sweep. - **Gravitational capture** determines routing. When a body enters another body's gravitational field, the modulation relationship is automatically established. No menu diving, no cable dragging, no manual assignment. - **Multi-body interactions** produce emergent complexity. Two moons orbiting the same planet create cross-modulation patterns that would require elaborate cable matrices in a traditional system but arise naturally here. ### Module Ecosystem (Celestial Bodies) Each module type is represented by a distinct class of celestial object, making the sonic role of every element immediately legible from its visual form: | Module | Celestial Form | Role | |--------|---------------|------| | **Master Audio Out** | The Sun | Central destination — all audio flows here | | **OSC (Oscillator)** | Planet / Star | Primary audio source — sine, saw, square, triangle, wavetable | | **LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator)** | Moon | Modulator — orbit speed controls rate, proximity controls depth | | **Residue** | Nebula / Asteroid Field | Textured noise generator — dust clouds of filtered stochastic signal | | **Nature** | Pulsar / Atom / Neuron | Models natural processes: heartbeat rhythms, synaptic firing, atomic decay | | **Swarm** | Flock | Multi-particle flocking
