# Project: Generative Art & Music Systems

## One-Line
Metasystem connecting theory to generative art practice through algorithmic composition.

## Short (100 words)
The generative art meta-system (Metasystem Master, ORGAN-II) connects theoretical frameworks from ORGAN-I to creative output — algorithmic composition, generative visuals, and interactive performance systems. This demonstrates the I→II dependency edge in practice: theory feeds art. The portfolio site showcases interactive p5.js generative art with a CMYK design system, 19 curated projects. The approach treats code as a creative medium and algorithms as compositional scores — extending the AI-conductor methodology into explicitly artistic territory.
