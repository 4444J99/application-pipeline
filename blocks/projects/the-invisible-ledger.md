# Project: Private financial tracking and accounting system

## One-Line
Private financial tracking and accounting system

## Short (100 words)
Private financial tracking and accounting system. An enterprise-grade internal operations dashboard for tax professionals who manage physical document workflows with digital precision — serving clients who reject traditional cloud platforms through high-touch service and privacy-first architecture. The Invisible Ledger exists at the intersection of two realities that modern fintech pretends do not coexist: the client who refuses to send a PDF over email, and the tax professional who needs sub-minute situational awareness across every document in their care.
