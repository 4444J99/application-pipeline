# Project: Private analytics and customer insights platform

## One-Line
Private analytics and customer insights platform

## Short (100 words)
Private analytics and customer insights platform. A "phygital" virtual try-on platform that bridges hyper-realistic beauty simulation with professional cosmetology operations — medical-grade skin diagnostics, AI-powered style coaching, real-time AR filters, and seamless salon booking in a single TypeScript application. Mirror-Mirror is a B2C product within ORGAN-III: Ergon, the commerce organ of the ORGAN system. It demonstrates how consumer-facing software can deliver genuinely useful utility — not novelty filters, but a truth engine that helps people make informed decisions about their appearance before committing time and money to a salon visit. Part of ORGAN-III (Ergon).
