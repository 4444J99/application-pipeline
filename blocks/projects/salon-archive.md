**Purpose:** The salon archive is the institutional memory of ORGAN-VI. Every gathering, conversation, and collaborative encounter that takes place within the koinonia community produces ideas, connections, and insights that deserve to persist beyond the moment of their articulation. This repository provides the infrastructure to capture, organize, index, and make discoverable the full output of the salon program. Without an archive, salons become ephemeral social events — enjoyable but structurally invisible. The conviction underlying this repository is that intellectual community produces *artifacts*, not just experiences. A well-indexed transcript is as much an output of the organvm system as a deployed application or a published essay. The salon archive transforms dialogue into a searchable, cross-referenced knowledge base that feeds back into the system: theorists in ORGAN-I discover connections they missed, artists in ORGAN-II find provocations for new work, and the public-process documentation in ORGAN-V draws on salon discussions for essay material. This is not a simple recording dump. The archive is designed with the same care applied to any other production system in the eight-organ model. Every session receives structured metadata, every transcript is indexed against the topic taxonomy, and every cross-reference to work in other organs is explicitly linked. The goal is an archive that becomes more valuable over time — a compounding resource for the community and for the system as a whole.

**Participation Model:** Salon participation operates on an invitation-only basis. This is a deliberate architectural choice, not gatekeeping for its own sake. The salons are designed for a specific kind of engagement: participants are expected to have read preparatory materials, to engage substantively with the session's provocation, and to contribute to the documented outcomes. Open attendance would dilute the depth of exchange that makes the format generative. Invitations are extended by the salon facilitator in consultation with the ORGAN-VI community steward. The criteria for invitation are intellectual engagement and willingness to participate in structured dialogue, not credentials or institutional affiliation. A thoughtful autodidact is as welcome as an academic; a practicing artist is as welcome as a theorist. What matters is the capacity and willingness to contribute to the shared inquiry.
