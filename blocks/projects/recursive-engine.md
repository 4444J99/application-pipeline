# Project: Recursive Engine

## One-Line
Symbolic operating system with 1,254 tests, 85% coverage, 21 organ handlers, and a custom DSL.

## Short (100 words)
The Recursive Engine is a symbolic operating system that processes entities through a pipeline of organ handlers — each corresponding to one of the eight organs. Built with 1,254 tests at 85% coverage, it implements a custom domain-specific language for defining symbolic transformations. The engine demonstrates that formal systems theory (ORGAN-I) can produce working computational infrastructure, not just theoretical frameworks. It's the bridge between the eight-organ model as a conceptual architecture and the eight-organ model as executable code.
