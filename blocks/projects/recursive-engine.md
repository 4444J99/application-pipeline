# Project: RE:GE

## One-Line
RE:GE — A symbolic operating system for myth, identity, ritual, and recursive systems.

## Short (100 words)
RE:GE — A symbolic operating system for myth, identity, ritual, and recursive systems. 21 organ handlers, ritual syntax DSL, workflow orchestration, external bridges (Obsidian/Git/Max-MSP).

**Problem Statement:** Software has no concept of significance. Traditional systems store data as flat records — a string is a string whether it represents a passing thought or a life-defining event. Databases optimize for retrieval, not meaning. Version control tracks changes, not transformation. There is no infrastructure for the recursive, layered, emotionally weighted processes that define how humans actually relate to symbols, memories, and creative output. This gap is not academic. Every creative practitioner who has built a body of work confronts it: the tools for *making* things and the tools for *understanding what those things mean* operate in entirely different planes. A musician can record a performance but cannot encode that the third phrase is a deliberate echo of a phrase from two years ago, that this echo has gained significance through repetition, or that the whole piece is a ritual response to a contradiction the artist has been processing across multiple works. The creative record is inert — a warehouse of files with no model of how they relate, accrete meaning, or transform over time. RE:GE addresses this by implementing a **symbolic operating system**: a computational framework where every piece of content carries charge (emotional/symbolic weight), flows through specialized processors (organs), and undergoes transformation according to ceremonial logic (protocols). The system treats meaning as a first-class computational object — not metadata attached to files, but the primary substrate that the system operates on. The contribution is epistemological. RE:GE provides a formal model for questions that are typically left to intuition: When does a recurring pattern become canonical? How should contradictions between creative fragments be resolved? What is the lifecycle of a creative idea from emergence through maturation to archival? By formalizing these processes as executable logic, RE:GE makes them inspectable, repeatable, and extensible — without reducing them to mechanical procedures. ---

**Core Concepts:** ### Concept 1: Fragments and Charge Dynamics The atomic unit of RE:GE is the **Fragment** — a piece of meaningful content (a symbol, a memory, a creative artifact) that carries a **charge** value between 0 and 100. Charge represents significance: how much weight this fragment holds in the system's
