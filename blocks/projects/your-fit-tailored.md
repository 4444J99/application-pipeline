# Project: Specification-driven seed for circular weekly apparel subscription platform

## One-Line
Specification-driven seed for circular weekly apparel subscription platform

## Short (100 words)
Specification-driven seed for circular weekly apparel subscription platform. A temporal service delivering continuous, low-friction apparel experiences through circular weekly subscription. Your-Fit-Tailored is a specification-driven seed for a circular apparel subscription platform. Users never shop, never decide, and never accumulate garments. A curated box of outfits arrives every week; the user wears the items, returns last week's box, and the system cleans, refurbishes, and redeploys inventory through a closed-loop pipeline. Fit confidence compounds with every cycle. Cognitive load asymptotically approaches zero. This is not a retail marketplace. It is a temporal service evaluated on throughput, latency, error recovery, and lifecycle yield — not conversion rate or sell-through. Part of ORGAN-III (Ergon).
