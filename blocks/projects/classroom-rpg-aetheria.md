# Project: Educational RPG system for classroom engagement

## One-Line
Educational RPG system for classroom engagement

## Short (100 words)
Educational RPG system for classroom engagement. A gamified education platform that transforms classroom learning into immersive role-playing experiences, mapping curriculum objectives to quest mechanics, XP progression, and AI-powered evaluation. Aetheria addresses the 40% dropout rate observed across online learning platforms by applying game-design psychology to structured education. Students do not simply complete assignments — they embark on quests within themed realms, earn artifacts graded by rarity, accumulate experience points that unlock progression tiers, and receive AI-generated feedback calibrated to curriculum standards.

## Full
**Product Overview:** Aetheria is a React-based single-page application built with TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It targets the $8B+ EdTech gamification market by combining three capabilities that existing platforms offer only in isolation: 1. **Deep RPG mechanics** — not surface-level badges, but a complete game loop with realms, quests, prerequisites, artifacts, knowledge crystals, constellation maps, and level-gated progression. 2. **AI-powered evaluation** — instant feedback on student submissions using LLM integration, with automatic remediation content generation, structured rubric scoring, and DOMPurify-sanitized output. 3. **Curriculum-first design** — every quest maps to specific CCSS ELA or AP Literature standards, every rubric aligns to institutional expectations, and every analytics view rolls up to mastery-level reporting by standard. The platform serves three distinct user roles — students, teachers, and parents — each with tailored interfaces, permissions, and interaction patterns. Teachers create realms (courses), populate them with quests (assignments), and monitor student progress through analytics dashboards. Students navigate a spatial quest map, submit work, receive AI feedback, and collect artifacts as tangible representations of their learning. Parents participate through a three-way voting system that shapes personalized content variants. ### Key Metrics from Internal Analysis - **13/13 core features** implemented in the current prototype - **35% production readiness** (active hardening underway — see Roadmap) - **9/10 innovation score** per internal nine-dimensional analysis - **4 complete thematic skins** with consistent vocabulary, geometry, and visual identity - **4 years of English Literature curriculum** pre-built with quests, rubrics, and standards mappings ---
