# Project: Interactive theatre dialogue example with server and client

## One-Line
Interactive theatre dialogue example with server and client

## Short (100 words)
Interactive theatre dialogue example with server and client. Interactive theatre where audience choices shape dialogue in real-time — a system for collective authorship of live performance. example-theatre-dialogue is an ORGAN-II demonstration project that reimagines theatrical dialogue as a participatory, branching, and recursively authored experience. Rather than treating the script as a fixed artifact delivered from playwright to performer to audience, this project treats dialogue as an emergent structure — one that arises from the interplay between pre-authored narrative scaffolding, performer improvisation, audience voting, and (optionally) LLM-assisted dialogue generation.
