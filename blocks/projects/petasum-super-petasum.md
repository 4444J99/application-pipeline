# Project: Organization-wide issue tracking with logic-first governance framework and co...

## One-Line
Organization-wide issue tracking with logic-first governance framework and conflict resolution

## Short (100 words)
Organization-wide issue tracking with logic-first governance framework and conflict resolution. Hat on a hat, galerum super galerum, quidquid superat, ad abundantiam, et cetera. A logic-first governance framework and cross-repository issue orchestration system for multi-organ organizations. Petasum provides the structural backbone that keeps distributed repositories, teams, and decision processes logically coherent as they scale. Part of ORGAN-IV (Taxis).

**Product Overview:** ### Why "Petasum"? The petasum (or petasus) is the broad-brimmed winged hat of Hermes, the Greek messenger god who moved freely between realms --- conducting souls, carrying messages, and translating between divine and mortal domains. In the ORGAN system, Petasum Super Petasum occupies an analogous role: it is the governance layer that sits atop other governance layers, the orchestration of orchestration, the hat upon the hat. The Latin phrase *galerum super galerum* --- hat upon hat --- is not decorative self-reference. It describes a real architectural pattern: **meta-governance**. When an organization spans eight organs, each with its own repositories, workflows, and decision cadences, the coordination problem is not merely technical but epistemological. You need a system that governs how governance itself operates. That is what Petasum provides. ### What This Repository Contains Petasum Super Petasum is a **template repository** and **living governance specification** for organization-wide GitHub infrastructure. It ships: 1. **A logic-first decision framework** --- a five-level principle hierarchy (Logic > Foundational > Operational > Community > Stability) with formal conflict resolution rules, logical derivation chains for every principle, and a documented escalation protocol. 2. **Organization-wide issue templates** --- structured GitHub Issue forms for cross-repository initiatives, multi-service incidents, and RFCs, all grounded in the logic-first framework. 3. **Automated workflows** --- GitHub Actions that route issues to organization projects, notify affected repositories of cross-cutting concerns, and enforce labeling conventions. 4. **A comprehensive implementation roadmap** --- six phases from foundation through continuous evolution, with gate reviews, success criteria, measurement frameworks, and risk mitigation strategies. 5. **A self-critique and audit trail** --- including a comprehensive critique document, principle conflict matrix, and implementation checklist that tracks adoption across the lifecycle. ### The Problem It Solves As distributed organizations grow, three coordination failures recur with monotonous regularity: - **Principle collisions**: Team A optimizes for speed; Team B optimizes for security. Neither is wrong, but without a hierarchy, every cross-team decision becomes a political negotiation rather than a logical resolution. - **Issue fragmentation**: A vulnerability affects twelve repositories. Without centralized tracking, each team discovers it independently, patches it differently, and nobody validates cross-repo consistency. - **Governance
