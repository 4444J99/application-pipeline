## Full
**1. Business Problem:** ### The Market Merchant Cash Advance (MCA) is a multi-billion-dollar alternative lending sector serving small and mid-size businesses that cannot access traditional bank financing. MCA providers purchase a share of a merchant's future receivables at a discount, offering fast capital in exchange for daily or weekly repayment drawn from card transactions or bank deposits. The US alternative business lending market exceeds $2B in annual origination volume, with thousands of MCA brokers and funders competing for the same pool of prospects. ### The Pain Every MCA transaction begins with a Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) filing --- a public record that a secured party (lender) has a lien on a debtor's assets. These filings are the single most reliable signal that a business has active financing and may need more capital. The problem is that UCC filings are scattered across 50 separate state Secretary of State portals, each with different interfaces, data formats, rate limits, and access mechanisms. A broker trying to find qualified prospects faces three compounding costs: **Data acquisition is manual and fragmented.** Each state portal requires separate navigation, often with CAPTCHAs, session limits, or bulk-download restrictions. A human researcher might cover 2--3 states per day. Covering all 50 states requires either a large team or months of sequential effort. **Lead quality is low without enrichment.** A raw UCC filing tells you that Company X has a lien filed by Lender Y. It does not tell you whether Company X is growing, profitable, compliant, or actively seeking capital. Without enrichment data --- revenue estimates, hiring signals, regulatory violations, credit indicators --- brokers waste outreach on businesses that will never convert. **Scoring and prioritization are subjective.** Even when a broker accumulates a list of UCC debtors, deciding which to call first is guesswork. There is no standardized way to rank prospects by likelihood of needing an MCA, ability to repay, or competitive positioning relative to existing liens. The result: MCA sales teams spend 60% or more of their time on data collection and manual qualification instead of closing deals. Lead-to-close cycles stretch to weeks. Conversion rates hover in single digits. ###
