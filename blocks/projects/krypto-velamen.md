# Project: KRYPTO-VELAMEN — The Instrument v1.0

## One-Line
Living queer cultural archive exploring concealment as compositional engine through 20 author studies and 26 world-building research modules.

## Short (100 words)
KRYPTO-VELAMEN is a public, evolving queer archive that documents lived interiority in real time, refusing narrative closure or moral framing. Its theoretical framework — "Double-Channel Text" — studies how queer writers encode desire through concealment mechanisms: surface story vs. substrate story. The research corpus spans 20 deep studies of queer authors (Wilde, Rimbaud, Burroughs, Baldwin, Lorde, Genet, Acker, Delany, Bishop, Cavafy, Forster, Mishima, Guibert, Feinberg, Arenas, Araki, Sophie, Lynch, Arca, Porpentine) and 26 world-building modules on queer cultural history, activism, and community governance. Original synthesis tools — Author Crosswalk, Mechanism Atlas, Visibility Schema — formalize patterns across the corpus. The platform architecture centers community safety through pseudonym management and risk-calibrated privacy.

## Full
KRYPTO-VELAMEN treats concealment not as biographical background but as a formal constraint that becomes a creative method — the "closet" as compositional engine.

### Encoding Schema: Six Dials
The project synthesizes queer literary strategies into six calibratable parameters:

**Concealment Dials:**
- **Rimbaud Drift** — Sensory overload and linguistic derangement as camouflage for desire
- **Wilde Mask** — Performative surface deployed to protect interior truth
- **Burroughs Control** — Cut-up, fragmentation, and structural disruption as encoding

**Visibility Dials:**
- **Lorde Voice** — Direct naming of experience as political and aesthetic act
- **Arenas Scream** — Excessive, baroque disclosure as resistance to erasure
- **Acker Piracy** — Appropriation and rewriting of canonical texts to inscribe queer presence

### Research Corpus
- **20 author studies:** Deep research on queer literary figures from Rimbaud (1871) to Porpentine (2010s), each analyzed through the double-channel framework
- **26 world-building modules:** Stonewall activism, queer spaces, chosen families, intersectional activism, creative frameworks, cultural histories, community governance, digital activism, eco-queer perspectives
- **Synthesis documents:** Author Crosswalk (7-variable comparison), Claims Ledger, Mechanism Atlas, Visibility Schema, Dial Calibration

### Platform Architecture
Microservices platform designed for community safety:
- Identity service with pseudonym management and risk calibration
- Community service with encrypted DMs and co-authoring capabilities
- Knowledge graph connecting authors, mechanisms, and cultural contexts
- Archive engine for evolving, non-linear documentation
