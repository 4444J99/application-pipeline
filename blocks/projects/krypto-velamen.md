# Project: KRYPTO-VELAMEN — The Instrument v1.0

## One-Line
A distributed, collaborative digital instrument for queer knowledge-building, authentic expression, and community survival through "Double-Channel" communication.

## Short (100 words)
KRYPTO-VELAMEN has evolved from a static archive into a distributed, collaborative platform. It is a digital instrument designed to facilitate queer knowledge-production and community survival. Its theoretical framework — "Double-Channel Text" — studies how queer subjects encode desire and interiority through concealment mechanisms: surface story vs. substrate story. The project coordinates 20 deep author studies and 26 world-building modules into a living infrastructure for authentic expression. The platform architecture centers community safety through pseudonym management and risk-calibrated privacy, allowing for the secure, non-linear documentation of lived experience in real time.

## Full
KRYPTO-VELAMEN treats concealment not as biographical background but as a formal constraint that becomes a creative method — the "closet" as compositional engine.

### Encoding Schema: Six Dials
The project synthesizes queer literary strategies into six calibratable parameters:

**Concealment Dials:**
- **Rimbaud Drift** — Sensory overload and linguistic derangement as camouflage for desire
- **Wilde Mask** — Performative surface deployed to protect interior truth
- **Burroughs Control** — Cut-up, fragmentation, and structural disruption as encoding

**Visibility Dials:**
- **Lorde Voice** — Direct naming of experience as political and aesthetic act
- **Arenas Scream** — Excessive, baroque disclosure as resistance to erasure
- **Acker Piracy** — Appropriation and rewriting of canonical texts to inscribe queer presence

### Research Corpus
- **20 author studies:** Deep research on queer literary figures from Rimbaud (1871) to Porpentine (2010s), each analyzed through the double-channel framework
- **26 world-building modules:** Stonewall activism, queer spaces, chosen families, intersectional activism, creative frameworks, cultural histories, community governance, digital activism, eco-queer perspectives
- **Synthesis documents:** Author Crosswalk (7-variable comparison), Claims Ledger, Mechanism Atlas, Visibility Schema, Dial Calibration

### Platform Architecture
Microservices platform designed for community safety:
- Identity service with pseudonym management and risk calibration
- Community service with encrypted DMs and co-authoring capabilities
- Knowledge graph connecting authors, mechanisms, and cultural contexts
- Archive engine for evolving, non-linear documentation
