## Short (100 words)
AI-personalized education system with multi-module curriculum spanning OS development, algorithms, DSLs, and mixed reality. Features Wings multi-artifact framework. An AI-personalized education system that transforms generic curricula into context-aware, multi-artifact learning journeys spanning OS development, algorithms, DSLs, kernel engineering, UI/sound/video, and AR/VR -- generating eight parallel professional outputs per module through a "Wings" multi-artifact framework. Part of ORGAN-VI (Koinonia).

**2. Curriculum Overview:** The curriculum is structured as nine modules plus a capstone, progressing from foundational tooling through increasingly sophisticated systems engineering. Each module builds on the previous one, and each generates a full set of Wings artifacts. ### Module Progression | Module | Title | Focus | Key Deliverables | |--------|-------|-------|-----------------| | 0 | ChainBlockARK & Foundational Wings | Self-documenting ledger of prompts, commits, builds, and AI interactions | Provenance chain, initial Wings templates | | 1 | Repo & AI Workflow Setup | Git, metadata conventions, VS Code + Copilot configuration | Configured development environment, CI/CD scaffolding | | 2 | Algorithms & Recursive Intuition | Recursion, data structures, visual explainers | Algorithm visualizations, complexity analysis documents | | 3 | DSL & Meta-Circular Interpreter | Lisp-style interpreter, tiny DSL for OS configuration | Working interpreter, DSL specification document | | 4 | Bootloader & Core Kernel Loop | 16KB assembly bootloader, QEMU-tested minimal kernel | Bootable kernel image, hardware abstraction layer | | 5 | Kernel Subsystems & Observability | Memory management, filesystem, I/O drivers, eBPF tracing | Observable kernel with tracing infrastructure | | 6 | UI, Sound & Video Ecosystem | 2D web terminal with audio, React Native mobile demo | Multi-modal interface prototype | | 7 | AR/VR & Neural-Symbolic Extension | AR overlay, VR scene, SMT checks, AI code generation | Spatial computing prototype, formal verification proofs | | Capstone | Unified Microkernel + Multi-Modal Platform | Integration of all modules into a single coherent system | End-to-end platform demonstration | ### Progressive Complexity The modules are ordered by dependency and conceptual difficulty. Modules 0-1 establish the learner's working environment and provenance infrastructure. Modules 2-3 build computational thinking skills (recursion, data structures, language design) that are prerequisites for the systems work in Modules 4-5. Modules 6-7 extend the kernel foundation into user-facing domains (interfaces, spatial computing, formal methods). The capstone integrates all prior work into a unified microkernel with multi-modal capabilities. This progression is deliberate. A learner who completes Module 4 (bootloader and kernel) has already internalized recursive thinking (Module 2) and language design (Module 3),
