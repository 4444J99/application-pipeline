# Framing: AI Orchestrator

**For:** AI-specific grants, tech roles, research fellowships
**Identity position:** AI tools as compositional instruments at system scale

## Opening
I orchestrate AI systems the way Brian Eno orchestrated the recording studio — as a compositional instrument, not a replacement for creative judgment. The ORGANVM project demonstrates AI-augmented methodology at institutional scale: 103 repositories built, documented, and validated using the AI-conductor model where human directs architecture and AI generates volume.

## Key Claims
- AI-conductor methodology is documented and reproducible
- Multi-agent framework (Agentic Titan) with 1,095 tests
- The methodology is the creative contribution, not the AI output
- Effort measured in LLM tokens, with transparent cost accounting

## Lead Evidence
- ~810K+ words produced through AI-conductor methodology
- Agentic Titan: multi-agent orchestration, 18 development phases
- Token-based effort budgets documented per task type
- 42 essays transparently documenting the human-AI workflow
