# Framing: Systems Artist

**For:** Art grants, residencies, prizes
**Identity position:** The system IS the artwork

## Opening
I am a systems artist who builds creative infrastructure at institutional scale. The ORGANVM project — 103 repositories coordinated across 8 GitHub organizations through automated governance — is simultaneously working infrastructure and an argument that governance, made visible, is itself the most interesting thing an artist can produce.

## Key Claims
- The eight-organ system is a living creative work, not a portfolio
- Governance structures are generative constraints, like a composer's harmonic rules
- 42 published essays are the primary creative output — process rendered into prose
- MFA Creative Writing grounds the practice in formal creative education

## Lead Evidence
- 103 repos across 8 orgs with automated governance
- 42 published essays (~142K words)
- 33 named development sprints over 5+ years
- MFA Creative Writing (FAU)

## Reference Points
Julian Oliver (critical engineering), Nicky Case (Explorable Explanations), Hundred Rabbits (radical transparency)
