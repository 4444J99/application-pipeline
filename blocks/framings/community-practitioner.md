# Framing: Community Practitioner

**For:** LGBTQ+ funding, identity-specific grants, housing-related funding, community programs
**Identity position:** Building creative infrastructure from lived experience of precarity

## Opening
As a queer, housing-precarious artist building creative infrastructure from lived experience of precarity, I understand that the systems we build reflect the conditions we build them in. The eight-organ system — including its community infrastructure (ORGAN-VI) and public documentation of 42 essays — was built as a model for sustainable creative practice accessible to others navigating similar circumstances.

## Key Claims
- Creative practice grounded in lived experience of LGBTQ+ identity, housing instability, and recovery
- ORGAN-VI (Koinonia) is dedicated community infrastructure: reading groups, salons, mutual learning
- Public documentation of process makes the practice reproducible for others in precarity
- The system demonstrates that institutional-scale creative work is possible without institutional backing

## Lead Evidence
- 42 published essays documenting the practice publicly
- ORGAN-VI with 4 community-facing repositories
- 101 repos built and maintained as a solo practitioner
- MFA Creative Writing (FAU)

## Reference Points
Mutual aid networks, community land trusts (organizational model), adrienne maree brown (emergent strategy), Dean Spade (mutual aid frameworks)
