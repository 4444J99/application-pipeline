# Framing: Art-Technology Collaboration (S+T+ARTS Prize)

ORGANVM operates through multiple layered collaborations between humans, algorithms, and audiences — each producing distinct art outputs.

**Audience-Performer-Algorithm (Omni-Dromenon Engine):** Audience members control continuous parameters — mood, tempo, intensity, texture — via mobile devices. Inputs aggregate through three-axis weighted consensus: spatial proximity, temporal recency, and cluster agreement. Performers retain graduated override authority (absolute, blend, lock). The algorithm mediates between collective desire and artistic judgment. Genre presets for ballet, electronic music, opera, installation, and theatre encode aesthetic priorities about what matters most in each form's audience-performer relationship. This is consensus as creative medium — the negotiation between audience, performer, and algorithm IS the artwork.

**Synthesis Organism (Alchemical Synthesizer / Brahma Meta-Rack):** SuperCollider generates audio through 10 synthesis engines. Pure Data processes and spatializes. p5.js visualizes organism state in real time via the Visual Cortex. Three ports of OSC communication create a feedback loop where sound, spatial processing, and visual state co-evolve. The 7-stage signal path (Brahma genesis through Shiva dissolution) models a living organism — generative systems including Lorenz attractors, Markov chains, and cellular automata drive emergent behavior.

**AI Agent Swarm (KRYPTO-VELAMEN):** An autonomous AI agent swarm contributes to the queer literary archive — not generating content but participating in community discourse, connecting fragments across the knowledge graph (106 entities, 118 relations), and surfacing concealment patterns across 20 author studies. The human-AI collaboration here is curatorial, not generative.

**Human-AI Conductor Model:** Across the full system, AI tools function as compositional instruments — generating volume that human editorial judgment shapes, the way Brian Eno treated the recording studio. 82+ automated pipelines mediate this relationship. The dependency graph (ORGAN-I theory feeds ORGAN-II art feeds ORGAN-III products) IS a designed collaboration pathway — each organ's output becomes the next organ's creative material.
