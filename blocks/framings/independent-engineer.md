# Framing: Independent Engineer

**For:** AI lab engineering roles, developer tooling, infrastructure positions
**Identity position:** Independent engineer building production-grade systems at scale

## Opening
Independent engineer with 5 years building production-grade Python and TypeScript infrastructure across 103 repositories coordinated through 8 GitHub organizations. The ORGANVM system — 21,160 code files, 3,610 test files (test coverage in 70 of 103 repositories), 94 CI/CD pipelines, and a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and 0 violations — demonstrates sustained engineering discipline at institutional scale, designed and maintained by a solo practitioner.

## Key Claims
- **Testing discipline:** 3,610 test files with coverage in 70 of 103 repositories; flagship projects at 1,095 tests (agentic-titan) and 1,254 tests with 85% coverage (recursive-engine)
- **CI/CD at scale:** 94 automated quality pipelines across active repositories
- **Architectural governance:** 43 validated dependency edges, 0 back-edge violations, 0 circular dependencies — enforced by automated validation
- **Systems architecture:** 103 repos organized into 8 domain-specific organizations with a formal promotion state machine (LOCAL → CANDIDATE → PUBLIC_PROCESS → GRADUATED → ARCHIVED)
- **Documentation rigor:** 100% CLAUDE.md coverage, 100% seed.yaml coverage, ~810K+ words of documentation and essays
- **Structured methodology:** 33 named development sprints with spec documents, retrospectives, and measurable deliverables

## Lead Evidence
- system-metrics.json: 21,160 code files, 3,610 test files, 94 CI/CD workflows (computed, verifiable)
- agentic-titan: Multi-agent orchestration framework, 1,095 tests, 18 development phases
- recursive-engine: Symbolic operating system, 1,254 tests, 85% coverage, 21 organ handlers, custom DSL
- 43 validated dependency edges with weekly automated checks, 0 violations
- registry-v2.json: Single source of truth tracking all 103 repos with implementation status, organ membership, and dependency declarations

## What to Acknowledge
- Independent practice — no team PRs, no code review with peers, no shared codebases
- No production users — systems are feature-complete but not deployed to external users
- LLM API orchestration, not ML training — uses AI as tooling, doesn't train models
- Teaching (11 years, 2,000+ students) demonstrates communication skills but is not engineering team experience
