# Framing: Emergency / Precarity

**For:** Emergency funds, housing stability grants, crisis assistance
**Identity position:** Working artist in acute need, demonstrating active creative practice

## Opening
I am a working artist and writer facing housing instability while maintaining an active creative practice. Over the past five years I have built and documented a 103-repository creative system across 8 GitHub organizations, published 42 essays, and continued to teach and produce work — all while navigating precarity. This funding would provide the stability needed to continue this practice.

## Key Claims
- Active, documented creative practice despite housing and financial precarity
- MFA Creative Writing provides formal grounding
- 18 years of professional experience across education, technology, and creative fields
- The work continues regardless of conditions — but stability would accelerate it

## Lead Evidence
- 103 repositories actively maintained
- 42 published essays (~142K words)
- 11 years of college instruction across 8+ institutions
- MFA Creative Writing (FAU)

## Tone Notes
- Direct, factual, no embellishment
- Name the specific need clearly
- Focus on what stability enables, not on hardship narrative
- Demonstrate active practice as evidence of commitment
