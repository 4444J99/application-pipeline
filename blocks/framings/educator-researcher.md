# Framing: Educator-Researcher

**For:** Education grants, fellowships, academic positions
**Identity position:** Teaching complex systems as creative practice

## Opening
With 11 years of college instruction across 8+ institutions and 2,000+ students, I have built a teaching practice grounded in making complex systems accessible. The eight-organ system I've documented in 42 published essays demonstrates this methodology applied to creative infrastructure — the same pedagogical instinct that makes a classroom work, scaled to institutional knowledge production.

## Key Claims
- 100+ courses taught across composition, literature, and creative writing
- Teaching IS the creative practice — not separate from it
- Documentation-first methodology is inherently pedagogical
- The eight-organ system is a teaching tool: it makes its own logic visible

## Lead Evidence
- 11 years, 8+ institutions, 2,000+ students
- 100+ courses (composition, creative writing, literature)
- MFA Creative Writing (FAU)
- 42 published essays as pedagogical artifacts
- Classroom RPG: Aetheria — gamification platform (React/TS) with AI-powered feedback and quest-based learning

## Targets
Spencer Foundation, NEH, Bread Loaf, state arts councils
