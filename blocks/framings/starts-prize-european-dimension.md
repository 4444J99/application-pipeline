# Framing: European Dimension (S+T+ARTS Prize)

The ORGANVM system's constitutional governance model directly parallels European institutional design. Its `governance-rules.json` encodes architectural principles — unidirectional dependency flow, promotion state machines, dependency validation — as machine-readable constitutional law. This is not metaphor: the registry (`registry-v2.json`) functions as a living constitutional document, amended through documented processes with full audit trails across 33 development sprints and 12 Architectural Decision Records.

The project inherits from and extends the European media art tradition. The lineage runs through Ars Electronica's engagement with art-technology convergence, ZKM's systems aesthetics, and Transmediale's critical technical practice. ORGANVM advances this tradition by making governance itself the generative medium — not depicting systems but building them as creative work.

Radical transparency aligns with EU open science and open culture values. Every repository is public. Every governance decision is documented. The 42 published essays (~142K words) constitute a real-time public process — creative methodology rendered visible and reproducible. The ~410K+ words of total documentation function as a digital commons contribution: reusable governance patterns, architectural templates, and a documented methodology for solo creative production at institutional scale.

The system's approach to AI — as compositional instrument under human editorial authority, not autonomous generator — resonates with the EU AI Act's emphasis on human oversight and transparent AI deployment in creative contexts.
