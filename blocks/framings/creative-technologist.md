# Framing: Creative Technologist

**For:** Tech grants, selective roles, accelerators, consulting
**Identity position:** Production-grade AI orchestration with creative applications

## Opening
I build production-grade AI orchestration systems that bridge creative practice and technical infrastructure. The ORGANVM project coordinates 103 repositories through automated dependency validation, a formal promotion state machine, and 94+ CI/CD pipelines — all designed, tested (2,349+ tests), and documented by a single practitioner.

## Key Claims
- Multi-agent orchestration demonstrated at scale (Agentic Titan: 1,095 tests)
- Automated governance with zero dependency violations
- Symbolic computing infrastructure (Recursive Engine: 1,254 tests, custom DSL)
- Documentation-first methodology producing ~810K+ words

## Lead Evidence
- 2,349+ automated tests across flagship repos
- 94+ CI/CD workflows
- 43 dependency edges, all validated, 0 violations
- Meta Full-Stack Developer + Google certifications

## Targets
Google Creative Lab, Processing Foundation, consulting clients, Together AI, HuggingFace
