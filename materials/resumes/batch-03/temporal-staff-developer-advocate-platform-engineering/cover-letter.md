To the Developer Relations and Platform Engineering Teams at Temporal,

I am writing to apply for the Staff Developer Advocate (Platform Engineering) position. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade infrastructure of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a uniquely rigorous perspective to platform advocacy. My work is defined by a "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the developers—and AI agents—that interact with it.

Temporal’s mission to be the reliable foundation of every developer’s toolbox resonates with my own commitment to technical integrity and systemic correctness. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale platform orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a deep understanding of self-service developer experience.

1. **Platform Orchestration at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the staff-level challenges of Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD, and GitOps because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional scale as a solo practitioner. I speak the language of Kubernetes, progressive delivery, and distributed systems natively, because these are the components of my own daily production environment.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Systemic Trust:** I believe that developer experience is a function of system trust. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that the "sample apps" and "workshops" I build for Temporal will not just be demos, but reliable architectural blueprints that other platform engineers can trust implicitly.

3. **Technical Advocacy and Mentorship:** I maintain a corpus of ~810K+ words of documentation and have documented my "AI-conductor" methodology across 42 published essays (~142K words). My background includes 11 years of college instruction, teaching 2,000+ students across 8 institutions. I specialize in simplifying complex distributed systems concepts—state management, workflow execution, failure handling—into actionable, peer-to-peer insights. I am ready to be the "voice and face" of Temporal in the platform engineering space, gathering the community feedback that drives product development.

I thrive in high-agency, high-intensity environments where the goal is to build reliable research computing environments. I am eager to help Temporal help other platform engineers enable their teams through durable execution and robust orchestration.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
