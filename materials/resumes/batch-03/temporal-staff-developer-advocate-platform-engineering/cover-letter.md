To the Developer Relations and Platform Engineering Teams at Temporal,

I am writing to apply for the Staff Developer Advocate (Platform Engineering) position. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade infrastructure of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a deep, firsthand discipline for the self-service platforms that Temporal enables. My work is defined by a "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the developers—and AI agents—that interact with it.

Temporal’s mission to be the reliable foundation of every developer’s toolbox resonates with my own commitment to systemic reliability. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale platform orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a deep understanding of the "golden path" for distributed systems.

1. **Systems Orchestration at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the complexities of state, idempotency, and progressive delivery because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional scale as a solo practitioner.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Correctness:** I believe that developer experience is a function of system trust. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that technical advocacy is backed by reliable infrastructure, helping platform engineers bring Temporal into their own systems with absolute confidence.

3. **AI-Conductor Methodology and Modern DX:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have documented my "AI-conductor" methodology across 42 published essays (~142K words). I bring a unique product intuition for how LLMs fundamentally change the developer experience, and I am eager to help Temporal design the workshops, sample applications, and guides that define the future of AI-augmented platform engineering.

I thrive in high-intensity, high-ownership environments where the goal is to ship meaningful work. I am eager to contribute to Temporal’s community, sharing a practice that treats cloud infrastructure as a steerable, transparent, and beautiful medium for creation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
