To the Enterprise Developer Relations Team at Temporal,

I am writing to apply for the Staff Developer Advocate (Developer Enablement) position. My background is uniquely bifurcated: I have spent the last 11 years as a college instructor, teaching 2,000+ students across 8 institutions, while simultaneously spending the last five years building production-grade technical infrastructure as an independent engineer. I am not just a developer advocate; I am an educator who builds his own orchestration instruments.

My candidacy is defined by the "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy. I maintain a deep, recursive "Cathedral" of systemic work—103 repositories coordinated across 8 GitHub organizations—while ensuring high-signal, scannable "Storefront" entry points for the agents—both human and artificial—that interact with it. This methodology, which I’ve documented in 42 published essays (~142K words), is exactly what is needed to define how enterprise developers learn and adopt Temporal in a post-COVID, LLM-enabled world.

I bring three core strengths to this role:

1. **Solo Production at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the staff-level challenges of state management, fault tolerance, and event-driven architectures because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional scale as a solo practitioner.

2. **Pedagogical Intuition Grounded in Practice:** Having taught composition and writing for over a decade, I understand the friction points of the learning process. I know how to design curriculum that moves beyond "completion" toward genuine competence. My teaching practice is grounded in making complex systems accessible, a skill I now apply to building AI-augmented pipelines that translate technical architecture into scannable instructional direction.

3. **AI-Native Engineering Discipline:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for how LLMs fundamentally change the developer education approach—specifically how AI-assisted learning and interactive labs can be utilized to scale what works across an enterprise.

I thrive in high-intensity, high-iteration environments where the goal is to bridge the gap between model capabilities and production-grade engineering rigor. I am eager to help Temporal set the instructional direction for its enterprise workshops and training experiences, building the reliable research computing environments that define the next generation of developer success.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
