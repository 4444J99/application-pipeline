  I am drawn to Anthropic’s mission because it treats AI research as an empirical science, focusing on the systemic reliability and steerability of models rather than isolated engineering puzzles. My own work over the last five years has been a solo exercise in "Big Science" at an institutional scale—managing a unified system of 103 repositories through automated governance, 2,349+ automated tests, and a formal promotion state machine. This mirrors Anthropic’s commitment to building single, cohesive teams that prioritize safety and benefit for society through secure foundations.
  
  As an independent engineer, I have built a "Cathedral" of infrastructure—deep, recursive, and highly disciplined—to support my own creative and technical production. I see a direct parallel between this and the sandboxing engineering required to enable Claude to safely interact with external systems. The challenge of agentic coding and secure code execution is not just model capability, but the engineering rigor and API-mindedness required to bridge those capabilities with real-world security. I want to build the sandboxing libraries and infrastructure that close this loop, ensuring that as Claude's capabilities scale, its interaction with its environment remains absolute in its transparency, correctness, and security.
  
  Thriving in high-intensity, high-iteration environments is my default state of operation. I have documented my "AI-conductor" methodology across 142K words of published research, exploring exactly where current agentic tools succeed and where their reliability gaps create friction for infrastructure engineers. I am eager to bring this power-user intuition and my background in complex systems orchestration to the Sandboxing team. I want to contribute to a culture that values correctness as much as research impact, building the reliable foundations that will define the next generation of steerable, beneficial AI.
