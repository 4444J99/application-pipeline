  I am drawn to Anthropic’s mission because it treats AI research as an empirical science, focusing on the systemic reliability and steerability of models rather than isolated engineering puzzles. My own work over the last five years has been a solo exercise in "Big Science" at an institutional scale—managing a unified system of 103 repositories through automated governance, 2,349+ automated tests, and a formal promotion state machine. This mirrors Anthropic’s commitment to building single, cohesive teams that prioritize safety and benefit for society through secure foundations.
  
  As an independent engineer, I have built a "Cathedral" of infrastructure—deep, recursive, and highly disciplined—to support my own creative and technical production. I see a direct parallel between this and the Integrations Engineering required to automate Anthropic’s quote-to-cash and go-to-market operations. The challenge of agentic coding and scaling a fast-growing organization is not just model capability, but the engineering rigor and system-level architecture required to bridge those capabilities with real-world business reliability. I want to build the Salesforce, Stripe, and Metronome integrations that close this loop, ensuring that as Anthropic’s revenue scales, its business infrastructure remains absolute in its transparency, correctness, and speed.
  
  Thriving in high-intensity, high-iteration environments is my default state of operation. I have documented my "AI-conductor" methodology across 142K words of published research, exploring exactly where current agentic tools succeed and where their reliability gaps create friction for revenue operations. I am eager to bring this power-user intuition and my background in complex systems orchestration to the Sales team. I want to contribute to a culture that values correctness as much as business impact, building the reliable foundations that will define the next generation of steerable, beneficial AI.
