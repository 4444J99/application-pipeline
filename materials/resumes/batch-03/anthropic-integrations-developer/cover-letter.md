To the Sales and Revenue Operations Teams at Anthropic,

I am writing to apply for the Integrations Developer position. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade infrastructure of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a uniquely rigorous perspective to business systems automation. My work is defined by a "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the agents—both human and artificial—that interact with it.

Anthropic’s mission to build reliable and steerable AI requires a go-to-market infrastructure that is equally trustworthy and efficient. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale systems orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a deep understanding of automated GTM workflows.

1. **Systems Orchestration and Integration at Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the staff-level challenges of quote-to-cash automation and cross-system data quality because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional scale as a solo practitioner. My focus is always on building flexible, secure, and scalable integrations—like my `Application Pipeline` suite—that turn complex requirements into predictable business outcomes.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Data Quality:** I believe that a business system is only as good as the trust it inspires in its stakeholders. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that the Salesforce, Stripe, and financial system integrations I build for Anthropic will not just be functional, but reliable infrastructure that ensures data integrity across every hop of the revenue lifecycle.

3. **AI-Conductor Methodology and GTM Automation:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for how LLMs can transform operational workflows—specifically how to automate time-consuming tasks in Hubspot, Salesforce, and Metronome. I have documented this methodology across 42 published essays (~142K words), exploring exactly where technical systems succeed and where reliability gaps create friction for business users.

I thrive in high-intensity, "zero-to-one" environments where the goal is to build secure foundations for society. I am eager to contribute to Anthropic’s Sales department, building the integrations and automation that will power our next phase of growth.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
