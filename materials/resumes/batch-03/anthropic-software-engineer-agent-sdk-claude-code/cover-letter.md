To the Claude Code Team at Anthropic,

I am applying for the Software Engineer, Agent SDK position. I have spent the last five years building exactly the kind of multi-agent orchestration infrastructure that this role requires — and the last year using Claude Code as my primary development tool to do it.

The most relevant project is agentic-titan, a multi-agent orchestration framework with 1,095 tests across 18 development phases. It implements agent composition patterns, structured tool routing, and state management for multi-step agent workflows. I designed this system while simultaneously being a heavy user of agentic coding tools, which gave me direct product intuition for where agent SDKs succeed and where they create friction. The gap between what an agent can technically do and what a developer can reliably compose into a workflow — that gap is the design space for agent SDKs.

The infrastructure supporting this work is substantial: 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, coordinated through automated governance with a validated dependency graph (43 edges, 0 violations). I maintain MCP server infrastructure providing structured capabilities to AI development tools, including filesystem access, memory persistence, and sequential thinking patterns. My recursive-engine project (1,254 tests, 85% coverage) implements a custom DSL with 21 organ handlers — experience directly relevant to building the kind of structured, composable interfaces that agent SDKs require.

The process discipline matters for this role. 3,610 test files with coverage in 70 of 103 repositories. 94 CI/CD pipelines. Every repository documented with CLAUDE.md files containing architecture notes and navigation protocols. I've documented my "AI-conductor" methodology across 42 published essays (~142K words), exploring how model capabilities compose into production systems and where reliability breaks down. This is the empirical groundwork for building an agent SDK that works — not just in demos, but under the pressure of real engineering workflows.

I should be direct about the gap: I have not worked on a team shipping SDKs to external developers. My multi-agent systems have no external users. What I bring is deep practitioner experience on both sides of the agent SDK boundary — as the person building the orchestration layer and as the person using agentic tools to build production infrastructure daily.
