  I want to build the agent SDK that professional engineers actually depend on. I've spent the last year using Claude Code daily as my primary development tool while simultaneously building multi-agent orchestration systems — agentic-titan (1,095 tests, 18 development phases) and recursive-engine (1,254 tests, 85% coverage, custom DSL with 21 organ handlers). This gives me direct product intuition for where agent SDKs succeed and where they create friction.

  The gap between what an agent can technically do and what a developer can reliably compose into a workflow — that gap is the design space for agent SDKs. I've experienced this gap daily: the context management challenges, the tool routing decisions, the state persistence problems, the error recovery patterns. My 42 published essays (~142K words) documenting the "AI-conductor" methodology are essentially field notes from the exact developer experience that the Agent SDK team is building for.

  Anthropic's approach to building safe, reliable AI aligns with how I think about infrastructure. My 103-repository system enforces zero-violation dependency governance, formal state machines, and automated quality gates — the same engineering discipline required to build an agent SDK that developers can trust in production. I want to bring this discipline and practitioner experience to the team defining how agents compose, delegate, and recover at scale.

  Key projects directly relevant to agent SDK work: agentic-titan (multi-agent orchestration, 1,095 tests), recursive-engine (custom DSL, 1,254 tests, 85% coverage), and MCP server infrastructure providing structured tool capabilities to AI agents. I also maintain the application pipeline that produced this submission — a 14-script CLI system demonstrating the structured workflow patterns that agent SDKs need to support. All work is publicly verifiable on GitHub.
