To the Google Artists and Machine Intelligence (AMI) Team,

I am applying for a Google AMI grant to support the continued development of **ORGANVM: The Eight-Organ Metasystem**. ORGANVM is an autonomous work of "Infrastructure Art" encompassing 103 repositories, 21,160 code files, and ~810K+ words of documentation, all coordinated across 8 independent GitHub organizations. It is an exploration of how we might build production-grade, steerable, and transparent AI-native environments for creative production.

My work is built on the "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive "Cathedral" of systemic logic while providing high-signal, scannable "Storefront" entry points for human-agent collaboration. In the era of frontier AI, I believe the most urgent creative inquiry is not just about what models can generate, but how we can orchestrate that generation through disciplined engineering.

I bring three core technical and creative strengths to the AMI community:

1. **Solo Production at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 94 active repositories through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero violations. This architecture is governed by a formal promotion state machine and sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows. I have built a system that mirrors the technical scale of a large institution as a solo practitioner, demonstrating a new model for creative agency in the AI era.

2. **The "AI-Conductor" Methodology:** I utilize 32 specialized AI agent definitions as compositional instruments to drive solo volume through structured review. This methodology, documented across 42 published essays (~142K words), treats AI not as a black-box generator, but as a steerable member of a high-performance orchestration team. My candidacy is built on the belief that the creative act is shifting from discrete production to systemic orchestration.

3. **Rigorous Integrity and Correctness:** I believe that AI-native art must be as reliable as the technology it utilizes. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my **Classroom RPG Aetheria** project, I’ve implemented AI-native environments with 100% pass rates across unit tests. This discipline ensures that the systems we build are robust, future-proof, and profoundly human-readable.

I am eager to contribute to the Google AMI community, sharing a practice that treats the infrastructure of creation as a primary site for aesthetic and technical innovation. I want to build the "operating system" for a future where human expression is amplified by transparent, governed artificial agency.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
