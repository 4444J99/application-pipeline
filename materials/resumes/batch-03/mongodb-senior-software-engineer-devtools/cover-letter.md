To the Database Experience Team at MongoDB,

I am writing to apply for the Senior Software Engineer (DevTools) position. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade infrastructure of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a deep, firsthand discipline for the developer experience. My work is defined by a "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the developers—and AI agents—that interact with it.

The mission of MongoDB's DevTools team to empower users to interact with their data at global scale resonates deeply with my own commitment to systemic reliability. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale systems orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a pioneering methodology for agentic applications.

1. **Systems Orchestration at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the complexities of maintaining an ecosystem of dependencies because I have architected and owned one from zero to production as a solo practitioner.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Correctness:** I believe that DevTools are only as good as the trust they inspire. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that developer tooling is not just a collection of scripts, but reliable infrastructure that prevents incidents and simplifies complex workflows.

3. **Frontier Tooling and Agentic Experience:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I have extensive experience building MCP servers and WebSocket-based communication layers designed for autonomous engineering tasks. I am eager to help MongoDB build the next generation of tools—like the MongoDB MCP Server and VSCode extensions—that will define how developers interact with data in the AI era.

I thrive in high-intensity, "big science" environments where the goal is to solve difficult problems in distributed environments. I’m also drawn to this role’s Dublin location on a personal level: James Joyce was a central subject of both my Literature BA and Creative Writing MFA, and his work continues to inform my own computational research — my `linguistic-atomization-framework` project applies formal decomposition methods to Joycean textual structures. The chance to build developer tools for MongoDB from the city where Joyce wrote *Dubliners* would be a meaningful convergence of my technical and intellectual commitments.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
