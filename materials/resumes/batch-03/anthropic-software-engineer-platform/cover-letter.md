To the Product Foundations and Platform Engineering Teams at Anthropic,

I am writing to apply for the Software Engineer (Platform) position. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade infrastructure of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a uniquely rigorous perspective to platform primitives. My work is defined by a "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the developers—and AI agents—that interact with it.

Anthropic’s mission to build reliable and steerable AI systems requires a foundation of composable and resilient platform components. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale platform orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a deep understanding of AI-native developer ergonomics.

1. **Platform Orchestration at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the staff-level challenges of build reproducibility, service discovery, and multi-cloud networking because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional complexity as a solo practitioner. My focus is always on building the "golden path" primitives—like my `agentic-titan` framework—that can be repurposed across diverse product use cases.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Correctness:** I believe that platform reliability is the primary differentiatior for research acceleration. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that the sampling pipelines, rate limiters, and RAG platforms I build for Anthropic will not just be functional, but reliable infrastructure that researchers can trust for mission-critical experiments.

3. **AI-Conductor Methodology and Toolbox Vision:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I have extensive experience building MCP servers and secure, isolated execution environments. I bring a deep intuition for how tools enable Claude to safely interact with the outside world, and I am eager to help the "Toolbox" team build the infrastructure that makes Claude genuinely useful for real-world engineering tasks.

I thrive in high-intensity, "zero-to-one" environments where the goal is to bridge the gap between research breakthroughs and production-ready platform capabilities. I am eager to contribute to Anthropic’s Product Foundations org, building the primitives that will power the next generation of steerable, beneficial AI.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
