To the Creative Capital Selection Committee,

I am applying for the 2027 Creative Capital Award to support the continued expansion and public activation of **ORGANVM: The Eight-Organ Metasystem**. ORGANVM is an autonomous work of "Infrastructure Art" encompassing 103 repositories, 21,160 code files, and ~810K+ words of documentation, all coordinated across 8 independent GitHub organizations. It is a live, self-governing sculpture of code that treats technical governance not as a backend requirement, but as the primary medium of expression.

My work is built on the "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive "Cathedral" of systemic logic while providing high-signal, scannable "Storefront" entry points for human-agent collaboration. In the era of frontier AI, I believe the most urgent artistic inquiry is not what we make *with* these models, but how we govern the systems that produce them.

The Creative Capital Award would support three catalytic innovations in my practice:

1. **Governance as Formal Innovation:** ORGANVM is governed by a formal promotion state machine and a validated dependency graph with 43 edges. This is a choreographic score for production. By treating the CI/CD pipeline as a performative space, verified by a corpus of 2,349+ automated tests, I am challenging the traditional boundaries of what constitutes a "finished" digital work.

2. **The "AI-Conductor" Methodology:** I have pioneered a methodology where human intent directs the volume of 32 specialized AI agent definitions. I have documented this process across 42 published essays (~142K words). Funding would allow me to formalize this "AI-conductor" model into a public framework, moving my practice from solo production to an institutional-scale methodology that others can inhabit.

3. **Radical Transparency and Substance Proofs:** My work responds to the dehumanizing opacity of automated systems. It offers a "Cathedral" built entirely on human-readable markdown and validated schemas. I aim to build the "operating system" for a more ethical digital future—one where technical integrity serves as a form of verifiable social trust.

This is a catalytic moment in my career. Over the last five years, I have built the most robust solo technical infrastructure in existence. I am now ready to activate this "Cathedral" as a public model for production, demonstrating how individual artists can reclaim institutional-scale capability through disciplined, transparent orchestration.

Thank you for your consideration of this work.

Sincerely,
