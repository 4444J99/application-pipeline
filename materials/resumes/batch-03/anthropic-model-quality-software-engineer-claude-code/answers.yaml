  I am drawn to Anthropic’s mission because it treats AI research as an empirical science rather than a series of isolated engineering puzzles. My own work over the last five years has been a solo exercise in "Big Science" at an institutional scale—managing a unified system of 103 repositories through automated governance, 2,349+ automated tests, and a formal promotion state machine. This mirrors Anthropic’s commitment to building single, cohesive teams that focus on the systemic reliability and steerability of AI, rather than fragmented feature sets.

  As an independent engineer, I have built a "Cathedral" of infrastructure—deep, recursive, and highly disciplined—to support my own creative and technical production. I see a direct parallel between this and the infrastructure required to make Claude Code a production-grade instrument. The challenge of agentic coding is not just model capability, but the engineering rigor required to bridge those capabilities with real-world reliability. I want to build the evaluation systems and tooling that close this loop, ensuring that as Claude's capabilities scale, its trustworthiness remains absolute.

  Thriving in high-intensity, high-iteration environments is my default state of operation. I have documented my "AI-conductor" methodology across 142K words of published research, exploring exactly where current agentic tools succeed and where their reliability gaps create friction for professional engineers. I am eager to bring this power-user intuition and my background in complex systems orchestration to the Claude Code team. I want to contribute to a culture that values correctness as much as capability, building the reliable research computing environments that will define the next generation of steerable, beneficial AI.

question_14793948008: My body of work is evidence-backed and verifiable via public GitHub metrics. I maintain a "covenant-ark" of 810K+ words of documentation and 2,349+ tests, all produced as a solo practitioner using AI-augmented development. I am not just looking for an engineering role; I am looking to bring this methodology to the team building the most advanced coding agents in the world.
