To the Claude Code Team at Anthropic,

I am writing to apply for the Model Quality Software Engineer position. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building production-grade infrastructure at scale, I have developed a deep discipline for the intersection of engineering rigor and agentic model capabilities. My work is defined by a "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining complex, recursive backend systems while ensuring high-signal scannability for the tools that interact with them.

My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale systems orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a power-user's intuition for the limitations of agentic coding tools.

1. **Systems Orchestration at Scale:** I currently maintain a unified system of 103 repositories coordinated across 8 GitHub organizations. This architecture is managed through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and 0 back-edge or circular violations. My experience in managing significant state and logic across fragmented components is directly applicable to the infrastructure required for large-scale model evaluations.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Correctness:** I believe that correctness is the primary differentiator in AI infrastructure. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that evaluation frameworks are not just measurement tools, but reliable infrastructure that researchers can trust implicitly.

3. **Agentic Tooling and Product Intuition:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools, including the early precursors to the capabilities Claude Code aims to solve. I have documented this "AI-conductor" methodology across 42 published essays (~142K words), exploring how model capabilities can be composed into institutional-scale production systems. I bring a strong product intuition for where Claude Code excels—and where its reliability gaps present the highest friction for high-intensity engineering environments.

I thrive in fast-paced, high-intensity environments where the goal is "big science" through cohesive engineering. I am eager to contribute to Anthropic’s mission of creating reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI by building the eval systems and infrastructure that will drive the next generation of Claude Code.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
