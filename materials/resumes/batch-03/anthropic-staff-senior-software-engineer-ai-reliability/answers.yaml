  I am drawn to Anthropic’s mission because it treats AI research as an empirical science, focusing on the systemic reliability and steerability of models rather than isolated engineering puzzles. My own work over the last five years has been a solo exercise in "Big Science" at an institutional scale—managing a unified system of 103 repositories through automated governance, 2,349+ automated tests, and a formal promotion state machine. This mirrors Anthropic’s commitment to building single, cohesive teams that prioritize safety and benefit for society through secure foundations.
  
  As an independent engineer, I have built a "Cathedral" of infrastructure—deep, recursive, and highly disciplined—to support my own creative and technical production. I see a direct parallel between this and the AI Reliability Engineering required to keep Anthropic’s most critical serving paths robust and resilient. The challenge of agentic coding and large-scale model serving is not just model capability, but the engineering rigor required to bridge those capabilities with real-world reliability across diverse cloud environments. I want to build the monitoring, observability, and high-availability systems that close this loop, ensuring that as Anthropic’s serving fleet scales, its reliability remains absolute in its transparency and correctness.
  
  Thriving in high-intensity, high-iteration environments is my default state of operation. I have documented my "AI-conductor" methodology across 142K words of published research, exploring exactly where current agentic tools succeed and where their reliability gaps create friction for production engineers. I am eager to bring this power-user intuition and my background in complex systems orchestration to the AIRE team. I want to contribute to a culture that values correctness as much as research impact, building the reliable research computing environments that will define the next generation of steerable, beneficial AI.

question_14950089008: I am a Full-Stack Developer (Meta) with an MFA in Creative Writing and 11 years of experience as a college instructor (2,000+ students). My background uniquely combines deep technical rigor with the ability to translate complex systemic concepts into accessible documentation and scannable reliability reports.
