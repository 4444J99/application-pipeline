To the Eyebeam Selection Committee,

I am applying for the **Speculating on Plurality** season to share and expand **ORGANVM: The Eight-Organ Metasystem**. ORGANVM is an autonomous work of "Infrastructure Art" encompassing 103 repositories, 21,160 code files, and ~810K+ words of documentation, all coordinated across 8 independent GitHub organizations. It is an exploration of how we might speculate on "plurality" not as a social abstraction, but as a technical and narrative architecture.

My work is built on the "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive "Cathedral" of systemic logic while providing high-signal, scannable "Storefront" entry points for the agents—both human and artificial—that interact with it. In the context of Eyebeam’s focus on experimental writing and gatherings, I offer a methodology where the act of building infrastructure is itself a form of storytelling.

I speculate on plurality through three core systemic layers:

1. **Plurality of Agency:** I utilize 32 specialized AI agent definitions as compositional instruments to drive solo production at institutional scale. This "AI-conductor" methodology, documented across 42 published essays (~142K words), treats artificial agency not as a tool for replacement, but as a primary participant in a pluralistic creative team. The interaction occurs at the interface of model capability and engineering rigor.

2. **Democratic Governance:** ORGANVM is governed by a formal promotion state machine and a validated dependency graph with 43 edges. By making the "rules of the system" visible and verifiable through a corpus of 2,349+ automated tests, I am exploring how we might build "Substance Proofs" for digital togetherness—where technical integrity serves as a form of verifiable social trust.

3. **Recursive Storytelling:** The metasystem is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows that represent the work's "metabolism." These workflows represent a live, self-correcting narrative that lives in the git logs and schema validations of the 103 repositories. My work challenges the assumption that digital art must result in a discrete file, offering instead a "Cathedral" of interconnected logic that explores how we might think, share, and play within the systems that define our future.

I am eager to contribute to Eyebeam’s return to New York City, sharing a practice that treats the infrastructure of creation as a primary site for gatherings, making, and speculative togetherness.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
