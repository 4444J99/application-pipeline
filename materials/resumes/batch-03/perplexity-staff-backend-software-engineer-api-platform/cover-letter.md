To the API Platform and Infrastructure Teams at Perplexity,

I am writing to apply for the Staff Backend Software Engineer (API Platform) position. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade infrastructure of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a uniquely rigorous perspective to API orchestration. My work is built on the "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the developers—and AI agents—that interact with it.

Perplexity’s mission to provide the world's most trusted answer engine resonates deeply with my own commitment to technical integrity and connected intelligence. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale systems orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a deep understanding of AI-native API design.

1. **Systems Orchestration at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the staff-level challenges of API versioning, dependency management, and multi-tenant performance because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional complexity as a solo practitioner.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Correctness:** I believe that an API platform is only as good as the trust it inspires. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that the foundational APIs and platform services I build for Perplexity will not just be performant, but reliable infrastructure that developers and model-driven systems can trust implicitly.

3. **AI-Conductor Methodology and Agentic Tools:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for how LLMs transform the API experience—specifically how APIs can be designed to make model-driven tool invocation more secure and predictable. I have documented this methodology across 42 published essays (~142K words), exploring exactly where technical systems succeed and where reliability gaps create friction.

I thrive in high-intensity, "zero-to-one" environments where the goal is to bridge the gap between model capabilities and production-grade engineering rigor. I am eager to contribute to Perplexity’s API team, building the platforms and tooling that will redefine how the world interacts with the knowledge of the internet.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
