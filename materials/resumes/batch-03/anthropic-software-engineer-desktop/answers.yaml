  I am drawn to Anthropic’s mission because it treats AI research as an empirical science, focusing on the systemic reliability and steerability of models rather than isolated engineering puzzles. My own work over the last five years has been a solo exercise in "Big Science" at an institutional scale—managing a unified system of 103 repositories through automated governance, 2,349+ automated tests, and a formal promotion state machine. This mirrors Anthropic’s commitment to building single, cohesive teams that prioritize safety and benefit for society through secure foundations.
  
  As an independent engineer, I have built a "Cathedral" of infrastructure—deep, recursive, and highly disciplined—to support my own creative and technical production. I see a direct parallel between this and the desktop engineering required to package Claude into an elegant, native experience for millions of users. The challenge of agentic coding and native OS integration is not just model capability, but the engineering rigor and product-mindedness required to bridge those capabilities with real-world stability. I want to build the Claude desktop app, ensuring that as Claude's capabilities scale, its local interface remains absolute in its transparency, correctness, and performant utility.
  
  Thriving in high-intensity, high-iteration environments is my default state of operation. I have documented my "AI-conductor" methodology across 142K words of published research, exploring exactly where current agentic tools succeed and where their reliability gaps create friction for desktop users. I am eager to bring this power-user intuition and my background in complex systems orchestration to the Desktop team. I want to contribute to a culture that values correctness as much as research impact, building the reliable foundations that will define the next generation of steerable, beneficial AI.

question_13549429008: I am a Full-Stack Developer (Meta) with an MFA in Creative Writing and 11 years of experience as a college instructor (2,000+ students). My background uniquely combines deep technical rigor with the ability to translate complex systemic concepts into accessible documentation and world-class desktop products.

question_13556504008: "I have over 5 years of experience building and maintaining complex technical infrastructure that includes desktop and CLI components. The most complex desktop-integrated system I've worked on is the ORGANVM Metasystem: a 103-repository autonomous ecosystem governed by 94 CI/CD pipelines and 2,349+ tests. This system utilizes a mix of TypeScript, Node.js, and Python, coordinated across 8 GitHub organizations to manage institutional-scale state and logic. My specific contributions involved architecting the formal promotion state machine and automated dependency validation (43 edges), ensuring a stable and performant local development environment for high-volume technical production."
