To the LACMA Art + Technology Lab Advisory Board,

I am applying for the Art + Technology Lab grant to share and expand **ORGANVM: The Eight-Organ Metasystem**. ORGANVM is an autonomous work of "Infrastructure Art" encompassing 103 repositories, 21,160 code files, and ~810K+ words of documentation, all coordinated across 8 independent GitHub organizations. It is an exploration of how the tools of institutional-scale engineering can be reclaimed as a primary medium for artistic expression.

My work is built on the "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive "Cathedral" of systemic logic while providing high-signal, scannable "Storefront" entry points for human-agent collaboration.

I propose to use the Lab’s resources to address three core systemic inquiries:

1. **The Aesthetics of Governance:** ORGANVM is governed by a formal promotion state machine and a validated dependency graph with 43 edges. I treat the CI/CD pipeline not as a utility, but as a choreographic space. Every commit is a performance, validated by a corpus of 2,349+ automated tests that serve as aesthetic sensors for correctness and integrity.

2. **Steerable AI Orchestration:** I utilize 32 specialized AI agent definitions as compositional instruments to drive solo production at institutional scale. This "AI-conductor" methodology, documented across 42 published essays (~142K words), shifts the focus from AI as a generative tool to AI as a steerable member of a collaborative team. I am eager to explore how LACMA’s technology partners might provide access to frontier models or specialized hardware to push the boundaries of this orchestration.

3. **Infrastructure as Public Model:** My work responds to the opacity of modern technical systems by offering a "Cathedral" built entirely on human-readable markdown and validated schemas. I aim to build the "operating system" for a more transparent digital future—one where technical integrity serves as a form of verifiable trust between the artist and the public.

LACMA’s history of fostering radical collaborations between artists and industry is the ideal environment for ORGANVM. I am eager to work with the Lab’s partners to explore how we might build more resilient, autonomous, and beautiful cultural infrastructures for the AI era.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
