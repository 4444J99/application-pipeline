To the Web Platform and Frontend Engineering Teams at Perplexity,

I am writing to apply for the Senior/Staff Web Platform Engineer position. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade infrastructure of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a uniquely rigorous perspective to full-stack web platforms. My work is built on the "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the millions of users—and AI agents—that interact with it.

Perplexity’s mission to provide the world's most trusted answer engine through an elegant, high-performance web interface resonates deeply with my own commitment to technical integrity. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale full-stack orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a deep understanding of AI-native developer ergonomics.

1. **Web Platform Orchestration at Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the staff-level challenges of build reproducibility, state management, and multi-cloud networking because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional scale as a solo practitioner. My experience spans the entire stack, from designing robust REST APIs to building high-performance, accessible frontends in React and Next.js.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Correctness:** I believe that a web platform is only as good as the trust it inspires in its users. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that the shared component libraries, BFF APIs, and deployment pipelines I build for Perplexity will be robust, scalable, and easy to maintain.

3. **AI-Conductor Methodology and UI Innovation:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for how LLMs transform the web experience—specifically how UI platform investments can be shaped around model capabilities. I have documented this methodology across 42 published essays (~142K words), exploring exactly how scannable "Storefront" design can mitigate the context density of deep systemic backend work.

I thrive in high-intensity, "zero-to-one" environments where the goal is to bridge the gap between frontier research and delightful user success. I am eager to contribute to Perplexity’s Web team, building the platforms and tooling that will redefine how the world interacts with information.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
