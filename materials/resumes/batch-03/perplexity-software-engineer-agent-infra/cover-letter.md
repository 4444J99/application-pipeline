To the Agent Infrastructure and Research Teams at Perplexity,

I am writing to apply for the Software Engineer (Agent Infra) position. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade ecosystem of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a uniquely rigorous perspective to agentic execution. My work is built on the "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the agents—both human and artificial—that interact with it.

Perplexity’s mission to provide the world's most trusted answer engine through agentic search resonates deeply with my own commitment to technical integrity and connected intelligence. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale systems orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a pioneer's methodology for agentic state management.

1. **Systems Orchestration and Autonomous Foundations:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the staff-level challenges of multi-step task execution and isolated compute because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional scale as a solo practitioner.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Correctness:** I believe that agentic infrastructure is only as good as the trust it inspires. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `agentic-titan` project, I maintain 1,276 tests reaching high coverage for complex, autonomous engineering tasks. This discipline ensures that the sandboxed execution environments and state management systems I build for Perplexity will not just be functional, but reliable infrastructure that developers can trust implicitly.

3. **AI-Conductor Methodology and Agentic State:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for how LLMs interact with long-running tasks—specifically how to design state management systems that handle checkpoints, recovery, and resumption across failure boundaries. I have documented this methodology across 42 published essays (~142K words), exploring exactly where technical systems succeed and where reliability gaps create friction.

I thrive in high-intensity, "zero-to-one" environments where the goal is to build tasteful, world-class products. I am eager to help Perplexity build the infrastructure that will power the next generation of agentic search, shipping fast while maintaining the highest standards of quality and reliability.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
