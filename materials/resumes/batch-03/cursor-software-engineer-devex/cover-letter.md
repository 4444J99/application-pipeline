I am a power user of agentic coding tools. Not casually — I have built an entire 103-repository system using AI-augmented development as my primary methodology, and I've documented that process across 42 published essays (~142K words) exploring exactly where agentic tooling works, where it fails, and what the developer experience gaps are. I'm applying to Cursor's DevEx team because I understand both sides: the engineering required to build reliable AI developer tools and the daily experience of depending on them.

The infrastructure evidence: 21,160 code files across 8 GitHub organizations. 3,610 test files with coverage in 70 of 103 repositories. 94 CI/CD pipelines. TypeScript strict mode on every TypeScript project. Python with type hints, structured CLI patterns, and ruff linting. The system includes a validated dependency graph (43 edges, 0 violations), a formal promotion state machine, and a machine-readable registry tracking all 103 repositories. Every repository has a CLAUDE.md with architecture notes, build commands, and navigation protocols — designed so that AI coding agents can orient themselves in the codebase.

That last point is the direct connection to Cursor's DevEx. I've spent years optimizing the interface between AI tools and codebases. The CLAUDE.md files, the seed.yaml contracts, the structured directory conventions — these are all developer experience surfaces designed to make AI-augmented development more effective. I know from practice what context an AI agent needs to be productive, what causes it to hallucinate or lose track of state, and what kind of project structure makes the difference between a useful tool and a frustrating one.

The developer experience engineering goes deeper. My application pipeline is a 14-script CLI system with consistent UX patterns: `--dry-run` before execution, `--batch` with confirmation, helpful error messages that report state and suggest next actions. My portfolio site uses a quality governance system that enforces standards through automation rather than convention. My MCP server infrastructure provides structured capabilities to AI development tools. These are all DX patterns — making complex systems feel predictable and reliable.

I should be direct about the gap: I have not worked on a product engineering team building developer tools at scale. My experience is as a power user and infrastructure builder, not as a team member shipping features to millions of developers. What I bring is the practitioner's intuition — 142K words of documented experience with where AI coding tools create leverage and where they create friction — and the engineering discipline to turn that intuition into product improvements.
