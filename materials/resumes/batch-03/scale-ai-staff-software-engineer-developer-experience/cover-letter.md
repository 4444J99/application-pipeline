To the Platform Engineering Team at Scale AI,

I am writing to apply for the Staff Software Engineer (Developer Experience) position. As an independent engineer who has built and maintained a production-grade infrastructure of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a deep, firsthand discipline for the "golden path" workflows that empower high-velocity engineering. My work is defined by a "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining deep, recursive systemic work while providing high-signal, scannable entry points for the developers—and the AI agents—that interact with it.

Scale’s mission to develop reliable AI systems for the world's most important decisions resonates with my own commitment to technical integrity. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale systems orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and an AI-native engineering methodology.

1. **Systems Orchestration at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files and 94 CI/CD pipelines as a solo practitioner. This architecture is governed by automated dependency validation, a formal promotion state machine (LOCAL → CANDIDATE → PUBLIC → GRADUATED), and a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. I understand how to build self-service, resilient platforms because I have architected and owned one from zero to production.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Correctness:** I believe that developer productivity is founded on system trust. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, including 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that developer tooling is not just a collection of scripts, but reliable infrastructure that accelerates research and development without compromising safety.

3. **AI-Conductor Methodology:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools, using them as "compositional instruments" to drive solo volume through structured review. I have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for how LLMs fundamentally change the build/test/deploy lifecycle, and I am eager to help Scale redefine how engineers develop software in an AI-native world.

I thrive in high-intensity, hyper-growth environments where the goal is to bridge the gap between model capabilities and production-grade engineering rigor. I am eager to contribute to Scale’s mission by building the platforms and tooling that will power the most advanced LLMs in the world.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
