  I am drawn to Anthropic’s mission because it treats AI research as an empirical science, focusing on the systemic reliability and steerability of models rather than isolated engineering puzzles. My own work over the last five years has been a solo exercise in "Big Science" at an institutional scale—managing a unified system of 103 repositories through automated governance, 2,349+ automated tests, and a formal promotion state machine. This mirrors Anthropic’s commitment to building single, cohesive teams that prioritize safety and benefit for society through secure foundations.
  
  As an independent engineer, I have built a "Cathedral" of infrastructure—deep, recursive, and highly disciplined—to support my own creative and technical production. I see a direct parallel between this and the UI Platform engineering required to scale Claude.ai to millions of users across diverse surfaces. The challenge of agentic coding and world-class consumer UI is not just model capability, but the engineering rigor and shared abstractions required to bridge those capabilities with real-world stability. I want to build the shared component libraries and BFF APIs that close this loop, ensuring that as Claude’s features scale, its user interface remains absolute in its transparency, correctness, and performant delightful usability.
  
  Thriving in high-intensity, high-iteration environments is my default state of operation. I have documented my "AI-conductor" methodology across 142K words of published research, exploring exactly where current agentic tools succeed and where their reliability gaps create friction for UI platform engineers. I am eager to bring this power-user intuition and my background in complex systems orchestration to the UI Platform team. I want to contribute to a culture that values correctness as much as research impact, building the reliable foundations that will define the next generation of steerable, beneficial AI.
