question_13635188008: "One meaningful thing I have done is building the ORGANVM Metasystem: a 103-repository autonomous ecosystem that treats technical governance as a medium for human-scale expression. By making the 'rules of the system' visible and verifiable through 2,349+ automated tests and ~810K+ words of documentation, I have demonstrated a model for 'Substance Proofs' where technical integrity serves as a form of social trust. This project represents my commitment to building transparent, steerable systems that amplify rather than replace human agency, documenting the process publicly to foster a culture of technical rigor and pedagogical transparency."

  I am drawn to Anthropic’s mission because it treats AI research as an empirical science, focusing on the systemic reliability and steerability of models rather than isolated engineering puzzles. My own work over the last five years has been a solo exercise in "Big Science" at an institutional scale—managing a unified system of 103 repositories through automated governance, 2,349+ automated tests, and a formal promotion state machine. This mirrors Anthropic’s commitment to building single, cohesive teams that prioritize safety and benefit for society through secure foundations.
  
  As an independent engineer, I have built a "Cathedral" of infrastructure—deep, recursive, and highly disciplined—to support my own creative and technical production. I see a direct parallel between this and the platform engineering required to accelerate product development at Anthropic. The challenge of agentic coding and building the world's most trusted AI platform is not just model capability, but the engineering rigor and tasteful API design required to bridge those capabilities with real-world developer success. I want to build the Claude Developer Platform and core APIs, ensuring that as Anthropic’s research scales, its developer interface remains absolute in its transparency, correctness, and performant reliability.
  
  Thriving in high-intensity, high-iteration environments is my default state of operation. I have documented my "AI-conductor" methodology across 142K words of published research, exploring exactly where current agentic tools succeed and where their reliability gaps create friction for backend engineers. I am eager to bring this power-user intuition and my background in complex systems orchestration to the Developer Platform team. I want to contribute to a culture that values correctness as much as research impact, building the reliable foundations that will define the next generation of steerable, beneficial AI.

question_13635194008: I am a Full-Stack Developer (Meta) with an MFA in Creative Writing and 11 years of experience as a college instructor (2,000+ students). My background uniquely combines deep technical rigor with the ability to translate complex systemic concepts into accessible documentation and world-class developer products.
