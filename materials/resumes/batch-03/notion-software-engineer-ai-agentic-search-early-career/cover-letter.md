To the AI Search Team at Notion,

I am writing to apply for the Software Engineer (AI Agentic Search - Early Career) position. While I am early in my formal career, my background is defined by high-intensity, "0→1" production: over the last five years, I have built and maintained a production-grade ecosystem of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations as an independent engineer. My work is built on the "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the developers—and AI agents—that interact with it.

Notion’s mission to make it possible for everyone to shape the tools they use resonates deeply with my own commitment to democratizing complex systemic architecture. I don’t just use Notion; I build the kind of "Connected Knowledge" infrastructure that defines your frontier. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: institutional-scale systems orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a pioneer's methodology for agentic context-management.

1. **Systems Orchestration at Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the challenges of maintaining a global state and connected knowledge because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional scale as a solo practitioner.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Correctness:** I believe that AI-native search is only as good as the trust it inspires. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that the agentic search tools I build are not just functional, but reliable infrastructure that provides verifiable results.

3. **AI-Conductor Methodology and Agentic Tools:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for how LLMs transform static search into active agency—where the "search" is the first step in a multi-step engineering task. I am eager to help Notion build the infrastructure that will define the future of connected intelligence.

I thrive in high-intensity, "zero-to-one" environments where the goal is to ship code that defines the frontier. I am eager to contribute to Notion’s AI team, building the platforms and tooling that will redefine how the world interacts with information.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
