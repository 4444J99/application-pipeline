To the Infrastructure and Systems Engineering Teams at Anthropic,

I am writing to apply for the Staff+ Software Engineer (Systems) position. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years architecting and maintaining a production-grade metasystem of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a uniquely rigorous perspective to technical strategy. My work is defined by a "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the researchers—and AI agents—that interact with it.

Anthropic’s mission to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems requires an underlying infrastructure that is equally resilient. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale systems orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a proven ability to set and execute technical direction at institutional scale.

1. **Systems Orchestration and Roadmap Strategy:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the staff-level challenges of translating high-level goals into concrete execution plans because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional complexity as a solo practitioner. My workflow orchestration demonstrates the technical strategy required to manage clusters and automation at massive scale.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Operational Excellence:** I believe that infrastructure uptime is a function of system trust. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that the clusters and observability tools I build for Anthropic will not just be functional, but reliable infrastructure that researchers can trust implicitly for mission-critical experiments.

3. **AI-Conductor Methodology and Technical Alignment:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for how LLMs transform the systems engineering lifecycle—specifically how infrastructure can be made more steerable and transparent through disciplined architecture. I have documented this methodology across 42 published essays (~142K words), demonstrating my ability to build alignment across technical stakeholders and communicate complex tradeoffs effectively.

I thrive in high-intensity, "big science" environments where the goal is to solve the hardest problems in distributed systems. I am eager to contribute to Anthropic’s Infrastructure organization, building the clusters and automation that will power the next generation of frontier AI.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
