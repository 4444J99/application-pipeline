To the Prix Ars Electronica Jury,

I am submitting **ORGANVM: The Eight-Organ Metasystem** for consideration in the Interactive Art+ category. ORGANVM is not a work made *with* a system; it is a work *of* system. It is a live, self-governing sculpture of code encompassing 103 repositories, 21,160 code files, and 810K+ words of documentation, all coordinated across 8 independent GitHub organizations. In ORGANVM, the infrastructure of creation is the primary aesthetic object.

My work is built on the "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive "Cathedral" of systemic work while ensuring high-signal, scannable "Storefront" entry points for the agents—both human and artificial—that interact with it.

ORGANVM redefines interactivity through three core systemic layers:

1. **Governance as Medium:** The project is governed by a formal promotion state machine (LOCAL → CANDIDATE → PUBLIC → GRADUATED) and a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero violations. This structure is not merely functional; it is the choreographic score of the work. Every commit is a performance, validated by a corpus of 2,349+ automated tests that serve as the work's "aesthetic sensors."

2. **Recursive Infrastructure:** The metasystem is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. These workflows represent the work's "metabolism," automatically pruning stale branches, validating schema integrity, and synchronizing state across the 8 organizations. The "Interaction" here is the constant, automated dialogue between the work’s intent (the code) and its reality (the build).

3. **Agentic Orchestration:** I utilize 32 specialized AI agent definitions as compositional instruments to drive solo production at institutional scale. This "AI-conductor" methodology, documented across 42 published essays (~142K words), shifts the focus from the finished image or sound to the orchestration of the capability itself. The interaction occurs at the interface of model capability and engineering rigor.

ORGANVM is a response to the "Frontier AI" era, challenging the assumption that digital art must result in a discrete file. Instead, it offers a "Cathedral" of interconnected logic that lives, breathes, and corrects itself in real-time. It is an exploration of how we might build steerable, trustworthy, and beautiful systems at the scale of our own imaginations.

Thank you for your time and for the opportunity to share this work.
