To the Privy Team at Stripe,

I am writing to apply for the Developer Experience Engineer position. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade ecosystem of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a unique "solo production at institutional scale" perspective to developer advocacy. My work is defined by a "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the developers—and AI agents—that interact with it.

Privy’s mission to make privacy and user ownership the default online resonates deeply with my own commitment to technical integrity and open-source transparency. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale systems orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a deep understanding of AI-native developer ergonomics.

1. **Systems Orchestration at Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the importance of simple, flexible developer tooling because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional scale as a solo practitioner. I specialize in turning complex technical systems into delightful, intuitive APIs.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Correctness:** I believe that developer trust is a function of system reliability. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that the code samples, starter repos, and recipes I build for Privy will not just be functional, but robust enough to serve as reliable production infrastructure.

3. **Technical Advocacy and Contentcadence:** I maintain a corpus of ~810K+ words of documentation and have documented my "AI-conductor" methodology across 42 published essays (~142K words). My background includes 11 years of college instruction, where I taught 2,000+ students to navigate complex technical systems. I specialize in simplifying frontier technology into scannable, actionable insights—the exact skill set required to proactive education and reduce support burden for Privy’s customers.

I thrive in high-intensity, experiment-driven environments where curiosity is encouraged. I am eager to help Privy bridge the gap between its product and the developer community, building the tools and initiatives that let developers shine and empower their users.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
