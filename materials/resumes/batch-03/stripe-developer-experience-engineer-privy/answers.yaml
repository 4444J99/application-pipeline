question_59133894: I am drawn to Privy because it treats privacy and ownership not as abstractions, but as foundational developer primitives. My own work—managing 103 repositories through automated governance—mirrors this focus on building simple, flexible tooling that puts the user (and developer) first. I want to build the "Storefront" layer for Privy’s delightful interfaces, closing the loop between complex cryptography and real-world developer success. I thrive in high-intensity environments where the goal is to build reliable, scale-tested infrastructure that empowers creators to build with confidence.
