  I am drawn to Anthropic’s mission because it treats AI research as an empirical science, focusing on the systemic reliability and steerability of models rather than isolated engineering puzzles. My own work over the last five years has been a solo exercise in "Big Science" at an institutional scale—managing a unified system of 103 repositories through automated governance, 2,349+ automated tests, and a formal promotion state machine. This mirrors Anthropic’s commitment to building single, cohesive teams that prioritize safety and benefit for society through secure foundations.
  
  As an independent engineer and veteran educator (11 years, 2,000 students), I have built a "Cathedral" of infrastructure—deep, recursive, and highly disciplined—to support my own creative and technical production. I see a direct parallel between this and the infrastructure required to scale the Claude builder community across EMEA. The challenge of agentic adoption is not just model capability, but the engineering rigor and pedagogical clarity required to bridge those capabilities with real-world developer success. I want to build the community flywheels and ambassador programs that close this loop, ensuring that as Claude's capabilities scale, its community remains the most trusted and technically rigorous in the world.
  
  Thriving in high-intensity, high-iteration environments is my default state of operation. I have documented my "AI-conductor" methodology across 142K words of published research, exploring exactly where current agentic tools succeed and where their reliability gaps create friction for professional engineers. I am eager to bring this power-user intuition and my background in complex systems orchestration to the EMEA Community team. I want to contribute to a culture that values correctness as much as capability, building the reliable community layers that will define the next generation of steerable, beneficial AI.
