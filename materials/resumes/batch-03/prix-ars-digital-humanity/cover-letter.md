To the Prix Ars Electronica Jury,

I am submitting **ORGANVM: The Eight-Organ Metasystem** for consideration in the Digital Humanity category. ORGANVM is a live, self-governing corpus encompassing 103 repositories, 21,160 code files, and ~810K+ words of documentation, all coordinated across 8 independent GitHub organizations. It is an exploration of how we might reclaim the vast, often opaque "Cathedral" of digital infrastructure as a site for human agency, transparency, and ethical orchestration.

In the era of frontier AI, the challenge of digital humanity is no longer just about making technology "user-friendly"—it is about making it "governable" by the individual. ORGANVM addresses this challenge by treating the infrastructure of creation as the primary aesthetic object.

My submission addresses the Digital Humanity category through three core systemic innovations:

1. **Radical Transparency in Governance:** ORGANVM is governed by a formal promotion state machine and a validated dependency graph with 43 edges. This structure is not hidden; it is the choreographic score of the work. By making the "rules of the system" visible and verifiable through a corpus of 2,349+ automated tests, I am demonstrating a model for "Substance Proofs" where technical integrity serves as a form of social trust.

2. **The "AI-Conductor" Methodology:** I utilize 32 specialized AI agent definitions as compositional instruments to drive solo production at institutional scale. This methodology, documented across 42 published essays (~142K words), shifts the focus from AI as a black-box generator to AI as a steerable extension of human intent. It is an inquiry into how human intelligence can direct artificial volume without losing the specific "Storefront" scannability that humans require.

3. **Human-Scale Translation:** The metasystem is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows that represent the work's "metabolism." These workflows automatically translate deep technical logic into scannable, high-signal interfaces. My work challenges the assumption that large-scale codebases must be inaccessible to the non-expert, offering instead a "Cathedral" built entirely on human-readable markdown and validated schemas.

ORGANVM is a response to the dehumanizing potential of automated systems. It demonstrates that as our technical capabilities scale, our systems of governance can become more beautiful, more transparent, and more deeply aligned with human values. It is an operating system for a more ethical, steerable digital future.

Thank you for your consideration.
