To the Accelerator Capacity Engineering (ACE) Team at Anthropic,

I am writing to apply for the Staff/Sr Software Engineer position within the Compute department. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade infrastructure of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a uniquely rigorous perspective to capacity orchestration. My work is defined by a "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable telemetry for the researchers—and AI agents—that depend on it.

Anthropic’s mission to build reliable and steerable AI systems requires an infrastructure that is equally trustworthy. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale systems orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a deep understanding of Kubernetes-native data pipelines.

1. **Systems Orchestration at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the staff-level challenges of managing heterogeneous environments because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional complexity as a solo practitioner. I speak the language of Python and Kubernetes natively, as they are the primary languages of my own daily production environment.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Correctness:** I believe that capacity engineering is only as good as the trust it inspires in technical stakeholders. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that the data pipelines and observability infrastructure I build for Anthropic will not just be functional, but reliable infrastructure that researchers can trust implicitly for real-time fleet health.

3. **Data-as-Product Thinking and AI-Native Workflows:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for how LLMs transform the compute lifecycle—specifically how observability data can be turned into scannable, actionable insights through "Storefront" design. I have documented this methodology across 42 published essays (~142K words), exploring where technical systems succeed and where reliability gaps create friction.

I thrive in high-intensity, "big science" environments where the goal is to bridge the gap between model capabilities and production-grade engineering rigor. I am eager to contribute to Anthropic’s ACE team, building the platforms and tooling that will maximize the utilization of one of the world's largest accelerator fleets.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
