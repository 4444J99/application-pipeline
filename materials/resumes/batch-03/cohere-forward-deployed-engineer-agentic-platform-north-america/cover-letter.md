To the Forward Deployed Engineering Team (North America) at Cohere,

I am writing to apply for the Forward Deployed Engineer position on the Agentic Platform team. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade infrastructure of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a uniquely rigorous perspective to "Agentic" deployment. My work is built on the "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the developers—and AI agents—that interact with it.

Cohere’s mission to enable the next generation of enterprise AI through reliable RAG and agentic workflows resonates deeply with my own commitment to technical integrity and systemic scale. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale systems orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a deep understanding of the "golden path" for AI-augmented production.

1. **Systems Orchestration at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the staff-level challenges of enterprise-scale digital transformation because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional complexity as a solo practitioner. I specialize in turning complex model capabilities into delightful, production-grade APIs for diverse customer environments.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Correctness:** I believe that agentic systems are only as good as the trust they inspire. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that the agentic platforms I build for Cohere’s North American partners will not just be demos, but reliable infrastructure that prevents incidents and simplifies user adoption.

3. **AI-Conductor Methodology and RAG Intuition:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for how LLMs and vector databases transform the enterprise experience—where the "agent" is the bridge between deep data layers and active operational workflows. I have documented this methodology across 42 published essays (~142K words), exploring exactly where models excel and where they require engineering safeguards.

I thrive in high-intensity, customer-facing environments where the goal is to bridge the gap between frontier technology and real-world ROI. I am eager to help Cohere’s North American partners build the agentic platforms that will redefine their industries, shipping fast while maintaining the highest standards of reliability.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
