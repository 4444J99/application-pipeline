Developer experience advocacy requires someone who can build, write, and teach — and who understands that the developer's experience of a tool IS the product. I've spent five years doing all three across a 103-repository system, and I'm applying to dbt Labs because the intersection of data engineering, developer tooling, and AI-augmented workflows is exactly where my practice has been heading.

The building: 21,160 code files across 8 GitHub organizations. A data pipeline architecture that includes YAML-driven state machines, automated enrichment workflows, and structured transformation logic — patterns that share DNA with dbt's approach to data transformation as code. My application pipeline (the system that generated this cover letter) is a 14-script Python CLI system that takes raw data (job postings, research notes, identity blocks) and transforms it through a governed pipeline into submission-ready materials. Every stage is validated, every transformation is auditable, and every output is reproducible. This is the data engineering mindset applied to a different domain.

The writing: 810,000+ words of documentation, 42 published essays, 100% CLAUDE.md coverage across all 103 repositories. I treat documentation as a product deliverable, not an afterthought. Each essay explores technical methodology, architectural decisions, or development philosophy — the kind of content that helps a developer community understand not just how to use a tool, but why it was built the way it was.

The teaching: 11 years of university teaching (2,000+ students) built my ability to meet developers where they are — to explain complex concepts without condescending, to create learning paths that respect the reader's time, and to write tutorials that actually work when someone follows them step by step.

The AI angle: I've built multi-agent orchestration systems (agentic-titan, 1,095 tests) and documented an "AI-conductor" methodology across 142K words of published work. I have direct experience with how AI coding agents interact with structured codebases, and I understand what makes a project AI-agent-friendly — structured conventions, machine-readable metadata, and consistent patterns. As dbt integrates AI capabilities, this practitioner knowledge of AI developer experience is directly relevant.

The gap: I have not used dbt professionally in a production analytics engineering environment. My data pipeline experience is in application orchestration, not in SQL-based data transformation. What I offer is the developer experience engineering sensibility — the ability to build, document, and advocate for a product from the perspective of the developer using it.
