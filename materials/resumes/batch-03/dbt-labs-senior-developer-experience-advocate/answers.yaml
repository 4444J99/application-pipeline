  While I have not created dbt-specific content, I have an extensive body of public work on data pipeline engineering, AI-augmented development, and developer experience:

  - 42 published essays (~142K words) documenting AI-conductor methodology, systems architecture, and development processes
  - 103 public GitHub repositories with 100% documentation coverage (CLAUDE.md + seed.yaml in every repo)
  - A YAML-driven application pipeline (14-script Python CLI system) that implements data transformation patterns: raw data intake, enrichment, validation, and structured output — conceptually aligned with dbt's transform-in-place philosophy
  - Multi-agent orchestration systems (agentic-titan, 1,095 tests) exploring how AI agents interact with structured data workflows
  - MCP server infrastructure providing structured AI tool capabilities, including data processing patterns
