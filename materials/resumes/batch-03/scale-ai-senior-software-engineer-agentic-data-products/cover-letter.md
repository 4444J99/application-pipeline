To the Agentic Data Products Team at Scale AI,

I am writing to apply for the Senior Software Engineer (Agentic Data Products) position. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade ecosystem of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a deep, firsthand discipline for the 0→1 builds that define Scale’s mission. My work is built on the "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the agents—both human and artificial—that interact with it.

Scale’s focus on grounding AI in real operational workflows resonates perfectly with my own commitment to technical integrity. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale systems orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and an AI-native engineering methodology.

1. **Systems Orchestration at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the staff-level challenges of maintaining complex state across fragmented data layers because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional scale as a solo practitioner.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Correctness:** I believe that agentic systems are only as useful as the trust they inspire. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that data products are not just "smart," but reliable infrastructure that provides verifiable outcomes for the world's most important decisions.

3. **AI-Conductor Methodology:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for how LLMs fundamentally change the developer experience and data retrieval lifecycle. I am eager to help Scale build the agentic frameworks that will demystify enterprise data layers and power the next generation of intelligent automation.

I thrive in high-intensity, "bias-to-action" environments where the goal is to bridge the gap between frontier models and production-grade engineering rigor. I am eager to contribute to Scale’s Agentic Data Products team, building the platforms and tooling that will redefine software engineering for the AGI era.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
