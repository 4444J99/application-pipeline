I'm also developing generative art systems using p5.js — my portfolio features a full-page canvas with three visual modes that composites behind the content layer.

  My largest-scale data work is the ORGANVM system itself: 21,000 code files, 3,600+ test files, 810,000+ words of documentation across 103 repositories. I built automated tooling to crawl, validate, and cross-reference this corpus — including dependency graph validation (43 edges, zero circular dependencies), registry synchronization, and batch pipeline processing across multiple data formats (YAML, JSON, Markdown).
