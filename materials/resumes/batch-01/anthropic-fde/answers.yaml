  Anthropic's approach to AI safety requires constraints that scale — not constraints that erode under pressure. The system I built solves the same problem at infrastructure scale: governance-rules.json encodes constitutional principles, and automated checks enforce them on every merge without human vigilance. The dependency validator blocks violations before they reach production. Monthly audits confirm system health. The constraints hold because they're structural, not procedural.

  I built agentic-titan, a multi-agent orchestration framework with 1,276 tests covering agent coordination, message passing, and fault tolerance. agent--claude-smith is a multi-agent system built directly on the Claude SDK — TypeScript, session persistence, self-correction hooks, and Zod schema validation. I understand what it takes to make agent systems reliable and deployable, which is exactly what the FDE team delivers to enterprise customers.
