  Anthropic's Ministry of Education is solving the problem I've worked on from both sides: how do you build genuine fluency with complex systems — not just product training, but understanding that compounds and transfers?
  
  I've taught 2,000+ students across 8 institutions over 11 years. I also built Classroom RPG: Aetheria — a gamified education platform where quests map to curriculum standards, AI generates rubric-scored feedback, and an educator dashboard tracks mastery by standard. That's the pedagogical instinct and the technical execution in one project.
  
  What drew me to this specific role is the content pipeline mandate. I built exactly this: my application-pipeline system manages 66 targets through a state machine with automated validation, scoring rubrics, and conversion tracking. I replaced ad-hoc prioritization with a system that's rigorous about what gets made and why. Your job posting describes the same philosophy.
  
  The gap between what Claude can do and what developers know how to build with it is an education problem. I'm an educator who builds with Claude every day — Claude Code, Claude Agent SDK, CLI tooling — and I want to close that gap at the source.

  Two things worth noting:
  
  1. My teaching experience (11 years, 100+ courses) was in college humanities — composition, creative writing, literature. But the pedagogical skills transfer directly: curriculum design, learning outcome measurement, translating complexity for varied audiences, iterating content based on student outcomes. Classroom RPG: Aetheria bridges the gap explicitly — it's an EdTech product I built with React 19, TypeScript, AI evaluation, and standards-aligned curriculum.
  
  2. My 103-repository system was built by one person using AI tools over ~18 months. Every repo has structured onboarding docs (CLAUDE.md, 100% coverage). Every sprint has a spec and retrospective. Every architectural decision is recorded. The system teaches itself to new contributors — which is exactly what developer education content does.
