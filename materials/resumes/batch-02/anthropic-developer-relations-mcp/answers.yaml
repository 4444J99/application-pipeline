  I use MCP every day. My development environment runs 7 MCP servers — filesystem, memory graph, sequential thinking, GitHub, Docker tools, Neon database, and Jupyter — coordinating across a 103-repository system. MCP is not an abstraction for me; it's production infrastructure I depend on.
  
  My AI-conductor methodology relies on MCP as the bridge between AI agents and external systems. Every repository in my eight-organ system ships with a CLAUDE.md file that configures how AI agents interact with the codebase. MCP servers provide the tool access that makes this workflow possible: reading files, running tests, committing code, managing databases, executing notebooks. I've debugged MCP transport issues, designed multi-server configurations, and built agent systems (agent--claude-smith on the Claude Agent SDK) that consume MCP tools as their primary interface.
  
  What draws me to this role specifically: MCP's developer experience has enormous room to grow, and I've felt every friction point firsthand. Server configuration is still too manual. Multi-server coordination requires tribal knowledge. The gap between "MCP exists" and "I'm building production systems with MCP" is exactly the kind of education challenge I've spent 11 years solving — first in classrooms (2,000+ students, 8 institutions), now through technical content (42 published essays, 810K+ words of documentation).
  
  I want to close that gap for the open source MCP community from direct practitioner experience.

  Two things worth noting:
  
  1. MCP-specific experience: My daily development workflow uses 7 configured MCP servers. I've built MCP server configurations for filesystem access (scoped to workspace), persistent memory graphs, and sequential thinking. The application-pipeline system that generated this submission uses MCP-connected tools throughout. This is hands-on protocol experience, not theoretical understanding.
  
  2. Open source commitment: My entire 103-repository system is public. Every repo has community health files (LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT). The governance structures — registry-v2.json, dependency validation, promotion state machines — are designed to be reusable patterns that other practitioners can adopt. I understand open source community dynamics because I've built with them as the foundation.
