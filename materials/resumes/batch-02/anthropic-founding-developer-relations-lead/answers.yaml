  I use Claude Code every day. Not experimentally — as core infrastructure. My AI-conductor methodology treats Claude as a compositional instrument: the human provides architectural vision, AI provides execution capacity at scale. This approach produced 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, 21,160 code files, 3,610 test files, and 810K+ words of documentation — all by one person.
  
  That daily practice gives me something unusual for a DevRel leader: I know exactly where developers get stuck with Claude, because I get stuck there myself. Context window limits. Tool permission flows. Multi-file coordination across repos. The gap between "this demo looks cool" and "I'm building production systems with it." I've navigated every stage of that fluency curve.
  
  Before building with AI tools, I taught complex systems to 2,000+ students across 11 years and 8 institutions. Developer relations at its core is education at scale — understanding how people learn, designing structured progression, measuring adoption that matters rather than vanity metrics. I've done that 100+ times in classroom settings and then applied it to developer documentation across 103 repositories.
  
  Anthropic is building the most capable AI systems in the world. The founding DevRel function determines whether developers actually build with those capabilities or just read about them. I want to build that bridge — from practitioner experience, not just from strategy decks.

  I want to address a gap directly: this role calls for 10+ years of experience building and leading developer relations teams. My DevRel experience is nontraditional. I've never led a DevRel team at a company.
  
  What I have done: built a 103-repository developer infrastructure system where every repo ships with structured onboarding documentation (CLAUDE.md files, 100% coverage). Published 42 essays (142K words) that serve as developer education content — teaching the AI-conductor methodology by demonstrating it. Created technical content including sample apps (agent--claude-smith on the Claude Agent SDK), tutorials, integration guides, and an open-source performance engine (Omni-Dromenon) with 200+ docs files including deployment playbooks and collaboration agreements.
  
  The teaching experience (11 years, 2,000+ students, 100+ courses) is directly relevant to "designing education programs that drive meaningful adoption." The content production at scale (810K+ words) is directly relevant to leading content strategy. The technical credibility — agentic-titan with 1,095 tests, recursive-engine with 1,254 tests at 85% coverage — means I can create my own code demos and critically review developer samples.
