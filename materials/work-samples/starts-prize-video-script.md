# S+T+ARTS Prize 2026 — Video Documentary Script

**Target duration:** ~3 minutes
**Production:** Screen recording (macOS) + voiceover (GarageBand) + editing (iMovie)
**Tone:** Confident, specific, art-forward. Lead with what the work looks like and does, not with abstractions.

---

## Segment 1: Hook (0:00–0:20)

**Visual:** MET4MORFOSES 3D node map rotating slowly, cross-fade to Brahma Visual Cortex organisms pulsing.

**Narration:**
"What if a single artist could produce an orchestra — not by playing every instrument, but by designing the system that makes music possible? ORGANVM is a creative system that generates performance, synthesis, literary archives, and immersive experiences — governed by the same constitutional principles that govern institutions."

---

## Segment 2: Art Outputs (0:20–1:10)

**Visual sequence:**
1. Omni-Dromenon audience interface on mobile device, performer dashboard showing live consensus (0:20–0:35)
2. Brahma Visual Cortex: SuperCollider running + Pure Data patches + p5.js web visualization in split screen (0:35–0:50)
3. KRYPTO-VELAMEN knowledge atlas, zooming into author connections, double-channel visualization (0:50–1:05)
4. Brief flash of MET4MORFOSES modes: 3D map, social feed, scroll experience (1:05–1:10)

**Narration:**
"The system produces four distinct art projects. Omni-Dromenon turns audiences into co-authors through real-time weighted consensus — 1,000 people, 2 milliseconds, the negotiation IS the artwork. The Alchemical Synthesizer models a living organism in sound — SuperCollider, Pure Data, and web visualization bound through three ports of OSC into a feedback loop. KRYPTO-VELAMEN archives 150 years of queer literary concealment strategies — 20 author studies, a knowledge graph of 106 entities, AI agents participating in the community. MET4MORFOSES transforms Ovid into an 8-mode web experience with 3D navigation, generative audio, and AI oracle."

## Segment 3: The System (1:10–1:50)

**Visual sequence:**
1. System dashboard: health overview, dependency graph (1:10–1:25)
2. GitHub org overview: 8 organizations, repository grid (1:25–1:35)
3. Terminal: registry-v2.json query, validation scripts passing (1:35–1:45)
4. Portfolio site: generative p5.js canvas, project grid (1:45–1:50)

**Narration:**
"These aren't separate projects — they emerge from a single governed system. 101 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations. A machine-readable registry. Automated dependency validation. A promotion state machine. The governance structures are generative constraints — the way a composer's harmonic rules shape what melodies can emerge. Every pipeline runs automatically. Every dependency is validated. Every architectural decision is documented."

---

## Segment 4: Process (1:50–2:20)

**Visual sequence:**
1. Public Process essays: scrolling through titles, opening one essay (1:50–2:00)
2. CI/CD runs: GitHub Actions green checkmarks, test suites passing (2:00–2:10)
3. Quick-cut montage: code, documentation, sprint records, ADRs (2:10–2:20)

**Narration:**
"42 essays document this in real time — the creative process rendered into prose as it happens. Not reflections on the work; they ARE the work. 2,349 automated tests. 33 development sprints. 410,000 words of documentation. AI tools function as compositional instruments — generating volume that human editorial judgment shapes. The process is the product."

---

## Segment 5: European Dimension + Close (2:20–3:00)

**Visual sequence:**
1. governance-rules.json scrolling, registry-v2.json structure (2:20–2:30)
2. Open repository grid: all public repos visible (2:30–2:40)
3. Work sample URLs appearing one by one (2:40–2:50)
4. Portfolio site hero shot, system dashboard, close (2:50–3:00)

**Narration:**
"The system's constitutional governance — machine-readable rules, dependency validation, promotion pipelines — parallels European institutional design. Everything is open source. Everything is documented. The 410,000 words function as a digital commons contribution: reusable patterns for how a single practitioner can produce creative work at institutional scale.

ORGANVM. One artist. One system. Four art projects. 101 repositories. The governance generates the artwork."
