  "identity_narrative": "ORGANVM produces four distinct art projects \u2014 real-time audience-participatory performance (Omni-Dromenon Engine), modular synthesis organisms (Alchemical Synthesizer), immersive literary web experiences (MET4MORFOSES), and a living queer literary archive (KRYPTO-VELAMEN) \u2014 all emerging from a single governed creative system of 101 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations.\n\nThe governance structures are generative constraints, the way a composer's harmonic rules shape what melodies can emerge. The system is built, documented, and operational \u2014 42 published essays document the methodology in real time, and ~410K+ words of documentation function as a digital commons contribution.",
  "artist_statement": {
    "long": "I build creative systems that produce art \u2014 the governance generates the artwork.\n\nThe ORGANVM system produces four distinct art projects: Omni-Dromenon, a real-time audience-participatory performance engine where 1,000+ people co-author the performance through weighted consensus algorithms; the Alchemical Synthesizer, a modular synthesis organism where SuperCollider, Pure Data, and p5.js co-evolve through three ports of OSC communication; MET4MORFOSES, an MFA thesis transforming Ovid's Metamorphoses into an 8-mode immersive web experience with 3D navigation, generative audio, and AI oracle; and KRYPTO-VELAMEN, a distributed queer literary archive studying concealment as compositional engine across 20 author studies and 106 knowledge graph entities.\n\nThese aren't separate projects \u2014 they emerge from a single governed system: 101 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, coordinated through a machine-readable registry, automated dependency validation, and a formal promotion state machine. The governance structures are generative constraints. 42 published essays document this methodology in real time \u2014 not reflections on the work; they ARE the work.\n\nI use AI tools as compositional instruments \u2014 the way Brian Eno treated the recording studio. The architectural vision, governance design, and editorial judgment are the creative work. Human directs, AI generates volume, human reviews. The result: a documented methodology for solo creative production at institutional scale.",
    "medium": "I build creative systems that produce art \u2014 the governance generates the artwork.\n\nOMNI-Dromenon turns audiences into co-authors through real-time weighted consensus. The Alchemical Synthesizer models a living organism in sound through SuperCollider, Pure Data, and p5.js. MET4MORFOSES transforms Ovid into an 8-mode immersive web experience. KRYPTO-VELAMEN archives 150 years of queer literary concealment strategies.\n\nAll four emerge from ORGANVM: 101 repositories, 8 organizations, automated governance. The governance structures are generative constraints. 42 published essays document the process in real time. Solo production using AI tools as compositional instruments \u2014 one artist, one system, four art projects.",
