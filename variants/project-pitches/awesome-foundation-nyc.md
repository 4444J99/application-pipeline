**Project Title:** KRYPTO-VELAMEN: A Living Archive of Queer Concealment and NYC History
**Project Website:** https://github.com/organvm-ii-poiesis/krypto-velamen

## Tell us about your awesome project! (Max 2000 chars)
I am building KRYPTO-VELAMEN, a public, evolving queer archive that treats "concealment" not as a tragedy, but as a compositional engine. Most queer history is told as a linear progression from "hidden" to "visible," but KRYPTO-VELAMEN studies how queer writers and activists—from the 1870s to 2020s NYC—actually *encoded* their desire into the work itself. 

The project spans 20 deep studies of queer authors (Wilde, Baldwin, Lorde, Acker) and 26 research modules on queer world-building, including Stonewall activism and NYC's chosen-family structures. I’ve built a formal "Encoding Schema" with six calibratable "dials"—like the "Wilde Mask" (performance as protection) and the "Lorde Voice" (direct naming)—to help researchers and the community map how we navigate between hiding and disclosure. 

This isn't just a static database; it’s a living infrastructure. It’s a microservices platform designed for community safety, featuring pseudonym management and risk-calibrated privacy. It asks: how can we build a digital home for queer interiority that is safe, radical, and radically transparent all at once?

## How will you use the money? (Max 500 chars)
The $1,000 will fund **"The Visibility Dial Pop-Up"**: 
1. **Physical Research Folios ($400):** Printing and distributing high-quality physical versions of the 20 author studies to NYC queer youth centers and community archives (like the Lesbian Herstory Archives). 
2. **Community Workshop ($400):** Hosting a "Double-Channel Text" workshop in NYC, where participants use my encoding schema to write their own histories.
3. **Public API Hosting ($200):** Maintaining the secure community server for one year.

## Tell us a little about yourself (Max 500 chars)
I’m an MFA Creative Writing graduate and NYC-based writing instructor with 11 years of experience teaching at institutions like Miami Dade College and Nova Southeastern. I’m a "community practitioner" working at the intersection of technical pedagogy and systems art. I believe that queer history belongs in the hands of the community, not just locked in academic journals, which is why I’m building open-source tools to make our collective memory interactive and accessible.

## For real though… how will this actually make your community more awesome?
It makes NYC more awesome by giving our community a new way to interact with its own history. Instead of just reading *about* Stonewall or Audre Lorde, participants can use KRYPTO-VELAMEN’s tools to understand the *mechanisms* of queer survival and creativity. By turning abstract research into tangible community folios and interactive writing workshops, we’re keeping the radical spirit of NYC’s queer intellectual history alive and reproducible for a new generation.
