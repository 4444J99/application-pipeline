## Tell us about your awesome project! (Max 2000 chars)
Over the last five years, I’ve built a digital "cathedral" called ORGANVM. It’s an eight-organ creative system spanning 103 GitHub repositories, coordinated through automated governance, 82+ CI/CD pipelines, and 2,349+ automated tests. But it's not just a technical project—it's a systems artwork. I’ve published 42 essays (approx. 142K words) documenting the process in real-time, including every failure, architectural pivot, and technical breakthrough.

While most AI projects focus on volume and speed, ORGANVM uses AI as a "compositional instrument" (like Brian Eno used the recording studio). It’s an experiment in what a single creator can achieve when they treat the *infrastructure* of creativity as the medium itself. The "awesome" part is the scale: one person, navigating housing instability in NYC, building a system that functions like a small institution, and then giving away all the blueprints, logic, and lessons for free.

## How will you use the money? (Max 500 chars)
The $1,000 will be used to transform this digital archive into physical community artifacts:
1. **Domain & Hosting ($200):** Consolidating the 8 organizations under a unified permanent .org home.
2. **Physical "ADR" Logs ($400):** Printing a limited run of the "Architecture Decision Records" and "Public Process" essays as tangible artifacts for local NYC archives and libraries.
3. **Community Salon V0.1 ($400):** Launching ORGAN-VI (Community) with a small pop-up gathering in NYC to demonstrate the participatory "Omni-Dromenon Engine."

## Tell us a little about yourself (Max 500 chars)
I’m an MFA Creative Writing graduate and NYC-based writing instructor who spent 11 years teaching 2,000+ students across 8 institutions. My practice sits at the intersection of technical pedagogy and systems art. I’m a "community practitioner" who believes that the most radical act an artist can perform today is radical transparency—showing the work behind the work. I'm currently building the infrastructure for a solo creative practice that operates at institutional scale.

## For real though… how will this actually make your community more awesome?
In an era of opaque AI "black boxes" and closed platforms, ORGANVM offers a model of radical transparency. By making the entire institutional memory of a complex project public—blueprints, failures, and all—I'm providing a reusable roadmap for other NYC-based independent creators, researchers, and students to build their own institutional-scale infrastructure without corporate gatekeepers. It makes the community more awesome by proving that "solo" doesn't have to mean "small."
