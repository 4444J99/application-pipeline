# Awesome Foundation NYC — Application Draft (KRYPTO-VELAMEN)

**Project Title:** KRYPTO-VELAMEN: A Digital Instrument for Queer Community Survival
**Project Website:** https://github.com/organvm-ii-poiesis/krypto-velamen

## Tell us about your awesome project! (Max 2000 chars)
KRYPTO-VELAMEN has evolved from a static archive into a distributed, collaborative digital instrument. It is designed to facilitate queer knowledge-building, authentic expression, and community survival through what I call "Double-Channel" communication. In an era where queer expression is often monitored, erased, or commodified, KRYPTO-VELAMEN provides the infrastructure for encoding desire and lived interiority into the work itself.

The instrument uses a theoretical framework of "Double-Channel Text"—the simultaneous existence of a surface story and a substrate story—to study how queer subjects have survived through concealment. The project synthesizes 20 deep studies of queer authors (from Rimbaud to Porpentine) and 26 world-building modules (covering NYC's Stonewall activism and chosen families) into a formal Encoding Schema. 

This is a living platform where community members can use calibratable "dials"—like the "Wilde Mask" or "Lorde Voice"—to document their own experiences securely. The architecture centers community safety through pseudonym management and risk-calibrated privacy, turning the "closet" from a site of tragedy into a compositional engine for collective resistance and authentic presence.

## How will you use the money? (Max 500 chars)
The $1,000 will fund the deployment of the collaborative "Instrument":
1. **Instrument Folios ($400):** Printing 100 copies of "The KRYPTO-VELAMEN Field Guide"—a physical manual for using the Double-Channel framework—to be distributed to NYC queer youth centers.
2. **"The Live Instrument" ($400):** Hosting a participatory community event in NYC where participants "play" the instrument by co-authoring a distributed archive entry in real-time.
3. **Secure Node Hosting ($200):** One year of high-security hosting for the platform’s identity nodes.

## Tell us a little about yourself (Max 500 chars)
I’m an MFA Creative Writing graduate and NYC-based educator with 11 years of experience teaching complex systems to 2,000+ students. I am a "community practitioner" working at the intersection of technical pedagogy and systems art. I build "instruments" because I believe the tools we use to tell our stories determine whether those stories can survive. My work is about giving independent creators institutional-grade infrastructure for radical, safe, and authentic expression.

## For real though… how will this actually make your community more awesome?
It makes NYC more awesome by giving our community a literal "instrument" for survival. Most digital platforms are designed to extract data; KRYPTO-VELAMEN is designed to protect interiority. By providing a framework for authentic expression that is safe from erasure, we are ensuring that the radical intellectual and emotional history of NYC’s queer community isn't just archived—it’s being actively built, updated, and transmitted by the community itself in real time.
