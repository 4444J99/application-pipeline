# Project Proposal: The ORGANVM System at ZKM

## Objective
To transition the ORGANVM eight-organ system from a documented research infrastructure into an active, public-facing media installation that invites community engagement and institutional collaboration.

## Context
The ORGANVM system is a 103-repository computational architecture built to sustain creative production through automated governance. It utilizes a machine-readable registry and a formal promotion state machine to manage the lifecycle of creative work across eight discrete "organs" (Theoria, Poiesis, Ergon, Taxis, Logos, Koinonia, Kerygma, Meta).

## Residency Plan
During the Rauschenberg Residency, I will focus on "Organ-VI: Koinonia" (Community) and the physical manifestation of "Governance as Art." The work will involve:

1.  **System-Audience Interface:** Developing interactive dashboards using custom CMYK design systems and p5.js that allow ZKM visitors to "probe" the 103-repository infrastructure and view the real-time status of the 33+ development sprints.
2.  **Constitutional Performance:** Hosting "salons" or "sprints" where the act of modifying the system's machine-readable constitution (`governance-rules.json`) is treated as a collaborative performance.
3.  **Cross-Organ Synthesis:** Completing the "Metasystem Master" integration, which bridges abstract systems theory (Organ-I) with tactile media outputs (Organ-II), creating a feedback loop between code and concept.

## Deliverables
- A public-facing "System Dashboard" compatible with ZKM's media presentation standards.
- A new series of "Public Process" essays (Organ-V) documenting the residency's technical and aesthetic breakthroughs.
- A finalized "Orchestration Hub" (Organ-IV) capable of managing cross-institutional artistic collaboration.

## Technical Requirements
- Access to high-performance computing for generative art rendering.
- Studio space for multi-screen media installation testing.
- Connectivity to the global ORGANVM GitHub infrastructure.
