# Artist Statement: ZKM Rauschenberg Residency

I build creative systems — the governance IS the artwork.

My practice centers on the ORGANVM eight-organ system: a documented infrastructure coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing across 103 repositories and 8 GitHub organizations. In the tradition of media art institutions like ZKM, I position the system itself as the primary site of aesthetic inquiry.

The process of creation is the product. My methodology, "Governance as Art," transforms the administrative and technical orchestration of a massive digital ecosystem into a performative act. The 42 published essays documenting this process are not mere metadata; they are the work itself — a real-time rendering of creative labor into a living, searchable corpus of over 810,000 words.

I utilize AI tools as compositional instruments, akin to Brian Eno's treatment of the recording studio. The architectural vision, the design of the governance rules, and the final editorial judgment remain strictly human. The result is a robust, production-grade infrastructure that supports solo production at institutional scale, validated by over 2,300 automated tests and a 100% success rate across 94 active pipelines.

For the Rauschenberg Residency, I seek to explore how these private systems of governance can be translated into public-facing media installations that allow audiences to interact with the underlying constitutional and technical structures of the artwork.
