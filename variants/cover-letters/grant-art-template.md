# Cover Letter Template: Art Grants / Residencies / Fellowships

**Use for:** Grant, residency, fellowship, and prize applications
**Adapt:** Replace [BRACKETED] sections with target-specific content

---

Dear [PROGRAM NAME] Selection Committee,

[1-2 SENTENCES: Why this specific program. Reference their mission language directly. Connect their values to your practice. Do NOT lead with credentials.]

## The Practice

I am a systems artist whose primary medium is creative infrastructure. The ORGANVM project — 103 repositories coordinated across 8 GitHub organizations through automated governance — is simultaneously working infrastructure and an argument that the process of creation, made visible and governable, is itself the most interesting thing an artist can produce. I have documented this practice in 42 published essays totaling over 142,000 words.

[1-2 SENTENCES: What this practice means for their program specifically. How would a grant/residency/fellowship advance the work?]

## Why [ORGANIZATION]

[2-3 SENTENCES: Specific connection to their mission, past grantees, or stated priorities. Reference something concrete — a past project they funded, a value statement from their website, a specific aspect of the residency/program.]

## What [FUNDING/RESIDENCY/FELLOWSHIP] Would Enable

[2-3 SENTENCES: Concrete deliverables or milestones this support makes possible. Be specific about what changes with their support that wouldn't happen otherwise.]

## Evidence

- **103 repositories** across 8 GitHub organizations with automated governance

## Template Notes

- **Word count target:** 300-500 words (most portals want concise)
- **Tone:** Confident, specific, direct. Avoid hedging language.
- **Do NOT:** Lead with biography. Lead with connection to their mission.
- **Do NOT:** Use "interdisciplinary" without specifics. Say what the disciplines are.
- **Storefront rule:** Cathedral-depth thinking, storefront-length expression.
- **Adapt identity position:** Use systems-artist framing for art grants, educator framing for education grants, community-practitioner for identity-specific funding.
