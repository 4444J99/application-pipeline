To the Acceleration and Infrastructure Teams at Perplexity,

I am writing to apply for the Software Engineer (Acceleration) position. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade infrastructure of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a uniquely rigorous perspective to engineering velocity. My work is defined by a "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the engineers—and AI agents—that interact with it.

Perplexity’s mission to provide the world's most trusted answer engine through rapid innovation resonates deeply with my own commitment to technical integrity and systemic scale. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale developer infrastructure orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a deep understanding of AI-native "golden path" workflows.

1. **Developer Infrastructure at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the staff-level challenges of build reproducibility, dependency management, and monorepo orchestration because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional complexity as a solo practitioner. My focus is always on reducing friction in the software development lifecycle to maximize "reach and responsiveness."

2. **Rigorous Testing and Systemic Velocity:** I believe that velocity is a function of system trust. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that the CI infrastructure and shared libraries I build for Perplexity will not just be functional, but reliable infrastructure that accelerates research and product development without compromising safety.

3. **AI-Conductor Methodology and Developer Tools:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for how LLMs transform the way engineers develop, build, and ship code. I am eager to help Perplexity build the internal tools and platforms that deeply integrate AI into the daily engineering workflow, turning model capabilities into a core multiplier for technical productivity.

I thrive in high-intensity, "zero-to-one" environments where the goal is to ship fast and build secure foundations. I am eager to contribute to Perplexity’s Acceleration team, removing the systemic bottlenecks that stand between a research breakthrough and a production deployment.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
