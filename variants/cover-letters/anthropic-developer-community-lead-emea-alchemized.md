# Cover Letter: Anthropic Developer Community Lead, EMEA

**Role:** Anthropic Developer Community Lead, EMEA
**Apply:** https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/anthropic/jobs/5113368008

---

To the Community and Brand Teams at Anthropic,

I am writing to apply for the Developer Community Lead (EMEA) position. My background is uniquely suited for this high-impact regional role: I have spent the last 11 years as a college instructor, teaching 2,000+ students across 8 institutions, while simultaneously building a production-grade infrastructure of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations as an independent engineer. I am not just a community manager; I am a builder who understands how to scale a technical flywheel through disciplined orchestration.

My candidacy is defined by the "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy. I maintain a deep, recursive "Cathedral" of systemic work—21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance—while ensuring high-signal, scannable "Storefront" entry points for the developers and builders that interact with it. This methodology, which I’ve documented in 42 published essays (~142K words), is exactly what is needed to adapt Anthropic’s global playbooks into localized, high-impact community activations across EMEA.

I bring three core strengths to this role:

1. **Solo Production at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 94 active repositories through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows and a formal promotion state machine. I understand the "golden path" for developers because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors the technical scale of a large institution as a solo practitioner. This technical depth allows me to engage credibly with EMEA builders and technical influencers.

2. **Pedagogical and Community Flywheel Expertise:** Having taught for over a decade, I understand how to recruit, mentor, and support ambassadors through clear, repeatable programs. I know how to convert community engagement into measurable impact. My teaching practice is grounded in making complex systems accessible, a skill I will apply to identifying unmet regional needs and building new community initiatives from scratch to support Anthropic’s B2C2B growth motion in Europe.

3. **AI-Native Advocacy and Content:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools, using them as "compositional instruments" to drive solo volume through structured review. I have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for how Claude Code and agentic workflows change the builder experience, and I am eager to represent Anthropic at conferences and in online communities across EMEA.

I thrive in fast-paced, ambiguous environments where the goal is to build secure foundations for society. I am eager to help Anthropic scale its developer community in EMEA, building the regional coverage map and attribution frameworks that prove the downstream impact of genuine community engagement.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
