# Cover Letter: Temporal Staff Developer Advocate, EMEA

**Role:** Temporal Staff Developer Advocate, EMEA

To the EMEA Developer Relations Team at Temporal,

I am writing to apply for the Staff Developer Advocate (EMEA) position. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade infrastructure of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a uniquely rigorous perspective to technical advocacy. My work is built on the "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the developers—and AI agents—that interact with it.

Temporal’s mission to be the reliable foundation of every developer’s toolbox resonates deeply with my own commitment to technical integrity and connected intelligence. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale distributed systems orchestration, a prolific culture of technical storytelling, and a deep understanding of the EMEA builder ecosystem.

1. **Systems Orchestration at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the staff-level challenges of state management, fault tolerance, and workflow execution because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional scale as a solo practitioner. I speak the language of distributed systems natively because it is my daily production environment.

2. **Prolific Technical Content and Advocacy:** I maintain a corpus of ~810K+ words of documentation and have documented my "AI-conductor" methodology across 42 published essays (~142K words). My background includes 11 years of college instruction, where I taught 2,000+ students to navigate complex systems. I specialize in simplifying concepts like Durable Execution and compensating logic into scannable, actionable insights—the exact skill set required to be the "voice and face" of Temporal in the EU.

3. **Rigorous Testing and Community Trust:** I believe that advocacy is founded on technical trust. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. This discipline ensures that the tutorials, blog posts, and diagrams I produce for the community are not just persuasive, but backed by production-grade evidence and technical correctness.

I thrive in high-intensity, "zero-to-one" environments where the goal is to bridge the gap between frontier technology and real-world developer success. I am eager to help Temporal drive developer engagement and open-source growth across EMEA, gathering the community feedback that drives product excellence.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
