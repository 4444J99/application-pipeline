To the UI Platform and Product Engineering Teams at Anthropic,

I am writing to apply for the Software Engineer position on the UI Platform team. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade infrastructure of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a unique "high-leverage" perspective to shared UI components. My work is defined by a "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the developers—and AI agents—that interact with it.

Anthropic’s mission to build safe and steerable AI requires a consumer interface that is equally stable and predictable. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale platform orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a deep understanding of AI-native developer ergonomics.

1. **Platform Orchestration at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the staff-level challenges of building shared component libraries and abstractions because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional scale as a solo practitioner. My focus is always on building the foundational tools—from CI/CD pipelines to shared React 18 libraries—that make shipping effortless for every other team.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Systemic Stability:** I believe that UI stability is a function of system trust. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my **Classroom RPG Aetheria** project, I’ve implemented AI-native environments with 100% pass rates across unit tests. This discipline ensures that the shared components and BFF APIs I build for Claude.ai will not just be functional, but reliable infrastructure that identifies and resolves latency issues before they reach the user.

3. **AI-Conductor Methodology and UI Innovation:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for how LLMs transform the user experience—specifically how UI platform investments can be shaped around model capabilities. I have documented this methodology across 42 published essays (~142K words), exploring exactly how scannable "Storefront" design can mitigate the context density of deep systemic work.

I thrive in high-intensity, rapidly evolving environments where the goal is to build outsized leverage through shared platforms. I am eager to contribute to Anthropic’s UI Platform team, building the tools and abstractions that will enable the next generation of Claude experiences across every surface.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
