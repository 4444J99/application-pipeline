To the Claude Code & Agent SDK Team at Anthropic,

I am writing to apply for the Software Engineer (Agent SDK) position. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade infrastructure of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a deep discipline for the "Agent-Human Hybrid" model of software development. My work is defined by a "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the developers—and the AI agents—that interact with it.

The Claude Agent SDK represents the foundational layer for the future of software engineering, and I am eager to contribute to its technical direction and developer adoption. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale systems orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a pioneer's intuition for agentic SDK design.

1. **Systems Orchestration at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the "golden path" for agentic workflows because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional scale as a solo practitioner.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Correctness:** I believe that an SDK is only as good as the trust it inspires in its developers. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `agentic-titan` project, I maintain 1,276 tests reaching high coverage for multi-step engineering tasks. This discipline ensures that the Claude Agent SDK will not just be a collection of APIs, but a reliable infrastructure that enables high-stakes production agents.

3. **AI-Conductor Methodology and SDK Intuition:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK itself. I bring a deep intuition for how LLMs transform the SDLC—specifically how clean SDK abstractions can mitigate model capability gaps. I have documented this methodology across 42 published essays (~142K words), exploring where current tools excel and where their reliability gaps create friction for professional engineers.

I thrive in high-intensity, "big science" environments where the goal is to build secure foundations for society. I am eager to help Anthropic build the "operating system" for autonomous agents, ensuring that every developer building on Claude has access to the most clean, intuitive, and powerful agentic layer in existence.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
