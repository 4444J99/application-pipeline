To the Growth & DevRel Team at ElevenLabs,

I am writing to apply for the Developer Relations Engineer position. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade ecosystem of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a unique "solo production at institutional scale" perspective to technical advocacy. My work is built on the "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the developers—and AI agents—that interact with it.

ElevenLabs’ mission to bridge the gap between frontier AI audio models and the global developer community resonates with my own commitment to making complex systems accessible and reliable. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale systems orchestration, a prolific culture of technical content, and a deep intuition for AI-native developer experience.

1. **Systems Orchestration at Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the "golden path" for developers because I have architected and owned one from zero to production.

2. **Prolific Technical Storytelling:** I have documented my "AI-conductor" methodology across 42 published essays (~142K words) and maintain a corpus of ~810K+ words of documentation. My background includes 11 years of college instruction, where I taught 2,000+ students to navigate complex systems. I specialize in simplifying frontier technology into scannable, actionable insights—the exact skill set required to help developers succeed with ElevenAPI and ElevenAgents.

3. **AI-Native Engineering Rigor:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools, using them as "compositional instruments" to drive solo volume through structured review. I have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. In my **Classroom RPG Aetheria** project, I’ve implemented AI-native environments with 100% pass rates across 45+ unit tests. I bring a deep intuition for how AI fundamentally changes the developer lifecycle and am eager to help ElevenLabs design the next generation of DX.

I thrive in fast-paced, high-intensity environments where the goal is to remove friction and empower creators. I am eager to help ElevenLabs drive technical user acquisition and community engagement by building the demos, documentation, and tools that define the future of AI audio.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
