To the ZKM Selection Committee,

I am applying for the Rauschenberg Residency to further develop the ORGANVM System, a generative art meta-system that treats institutional governance and technical infrastructure as the primary medium of artistic practice. My work aligns with ZKM’s tradition of media art by positioning the "system" itself as the artwork.

My practice is built on a massive computational foundation of 103 GitHub repositories, 94 of which are currently active. This infrastructure is maintained with the rigor of high-stakes software engineering, including 2,349 automated tests and 94+ CI/CD workflows that ensure 100% code coverage and architectural integrity. This scale enables me to move beyond the production of isolated objects and instead engineer a living, self-documenting corpus of over 810,000 words.

During the residency, I intend to utilize my "Metasystem Master" framework to bridge the gap between abstract systems theory and tactile media art. My methodology, "Governance as Art," transforms administrative and technical orchestration into a performative act. I have completed 33 named development sprints, each functioning as a discrete movement within a larger systemic symphony. This approach allows for the creation of artworks that are not only visually complex—utilizing p5.js and custom CMYK design systems—but are also computationally verifiable and architecturally sound.

I hold an MFA in Creative Writing and have 11 years of experience in higher education, which informs my ability to synthesize complex technical data into accessible narratives. My portfolio site at https://4444j99.github.io/portfolio/ showcases 19 curated projects that demonstrate my ability to balance aesthetic output with technical depth. As a systems artist, I am uniquely positioned to contribute to the ZKM ecosystem by demonstrating how contemporary art can be engineered as a robust, scalable, and transparent platform.

The Rauschenberg Residency offers the critical studio space and institutional context needed to transition the ORGANVM System from a private research environment to a public-facing media installation. I look forward to the possibility of collaborating with the ZKM community to explore the future of systems-based media art.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
