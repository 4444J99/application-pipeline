To the Claude Developer Platform and Product Engineering Teams at Anthropic,

I am writing to apply for the Staff Software Engineer (Backend) position on the Claude Developer Platform team. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade infrastructure of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a unique "lead contributor" perspective to API orchestration. My work is defined by a "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the developers—and AI agents—that interact with it.

Anthropic’s mission to build the world's most trusted AI platform for developers resonates deeply with my own engineering methodology. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale distributed systems orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a product-minded approach to agentic APIs.

1. **Systems Orchestration at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the staff-level challenges of scaling APIs and maintaining consistency because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional complexity as a solo practitioner. I speak the language of Python, FastAPI, and Kubernetes natively, as they are the primary components of my own daily production environment.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Correctness:** I believe that an API is only as good as the trust it inspires. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that the foundational intelligence, knowledge workers, and agent orchestration APIs I build for Anthropic will not just be performant, but reliable infrastructure that developers can trust for groundbreaking applications.

3. **AI-Conductor Methodology and Product Sense:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for how LLMs transform the backend—specifically how tool use, vision, and long-running task execution can be productized into intuitive developer experiences. I have documented this methodology across 42 published essays (~142K words), demonstrating my ability to bridge the gap between engine developers and user success.

I thrive in high-intensity, "zero-to-one" environments where the goal is to build tasteful, world-class products. I am eager to contribute to Anthropic’s mission, building the platforms and tooling that will redefine software engineering for the AGI era.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
