To the AI Platform and Research Engineering Teams at Perplexity,

I am writing to apply for the Software Engineer position on the AI Platform team. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade infrastructure of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a uniquely rigorous perspective to platform orchestration. My work is defined by a "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the researchers—and AI agents—that interact with it.

Perplexity’s mission to build the world's most trusted answer engine through frontier AI research resonates deeply with my own commitment to technical integrity and connected intelligence. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale systems orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a deep understanding of AI-native developer ergonomics.

1. **Systems Orchestration at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the staff-level challenges of experiment orchestration, model serving, and resource management because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional scale as a solo practitioner.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Correctness:** I believe that an AI platform is only as good as the trust it inspires in technical stakeholders. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that the foundational platforms and serving infrastructure I build for Perplexity will not just be performant, but reliable infrastructure that researchers can trust implicitly.

3. **AI-Conductor Methodology and Platform Vision:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for how LLMs can be leveraged to build more powerful platforms—specifically how to automate research workflows and model evaluations. I have documented this methodology across 42 published essays (~142K words), exploring where technical systems succeed and where reliability gaps create friction.

I thrive in high-intensity, "zero-to-one" environments where the goal is to bridge the gap between research breakthroughs and production-grade engineering rigor. I am eager to contribute to Perplexity’s AI Platform team, building the infrastructure that will power the future of steerable, beneficial AI.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
