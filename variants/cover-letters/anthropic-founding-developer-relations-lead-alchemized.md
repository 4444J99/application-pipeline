Dear Hiring Team,

103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, 810,000+ words of public documentation, and 42 published essays — all produced by one person using Claude as a compositional instrument. I'm applying for the Founding Developer Relations Lead because I've spent the past 18 months living inside the developer experience problem this role exists to solve: how developers discover, onboard, build, and scale applications with AI.

My daily workflow is a developer relations case study. I use Claude Code to build production infrastructure: a multi-agent orchestration framework with 1,095 tests, a Greenhouse API submission system, a portfolio site build pipeline, and a career application pipeline with automated validation and conversion tracking. The AI-conductor methodology I developed — one human architect directing AI coding agents — produced 21,160 code files, 3,610 test files, and 94 CI/CD pipelines. Every repository ships with a CLAUDE.md file that gives developers and AI agents the context they need to work effectively. I've been doing developer enablement at system scale.

Before building with AI tools, I spent 11 years teaching complex systems to 2,000+ students across 8 institutions. The skill that transfers most directly: understanding how people learn, where they get stuck, and what content they need at each stage of fluency. I've designed 100+ courses, measured learning outcomes, and iterated on curricula — the same build-measure-learn loop that scales developer adoption programs.

What I'd bring to this founding role: technical credibility from building production systems with Claude daily, content creation at scale (42 essays totaling 142K words, published as the system was being built), and the pedagogical instinct to design education programs that drive meaningful adoption rather than surface-level engagement. My agent--claude-smith project — a multi-agent system built on the Claude Agent SDK with session persistence and self-correction hooks — demonstrates the kind of hands-on code demos and sample apps this role produces.

I understand developer psychology from both sides: as a practitioner who has felt every friction point in AI-assisted development (context window limits, tool permission flows, multi-file coordination), and as an educator who knows that genuine fluency requires structured progression, not just documentation. The 42 published essays are my proof of concept — they teach the AI-conductor methodology by showing it in practice, including the failures.

I'm based in New York City, open to 25% in-office, and available to start immediately.
