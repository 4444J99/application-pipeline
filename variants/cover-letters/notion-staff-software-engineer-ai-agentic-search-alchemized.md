To the AI Search Team at Notion,

I am writing to apply for the Staff Software Engineer (AI Agentic Search) position. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade ecosystem of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a deep discipline for the "Connected Knowledge" problem. My work is built on the "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the developers—and AI agents—that interact with it.

Notion’s mission to make it possible for everyone to shape the tools they use resonates deeply with my own commitment to democratizing complex systemic architecture. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale systems orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a pioneering methodology for agentic context-management.

1. **Systems Orchestration at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the staff-level challenges of maintaining a global state because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional scale as a solo practitioner.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Correctness:** I believe that AI-native search is only as good as the trust it inspires. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that agentic search is not just a black box of retrieval, but a reliable infrastructure that provides verifiable, high-signal results.

3. **AI-Conductor Methodology and Agentic Tools:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for how LLMs transform static search into active agency—where the "search" is the first step in a multi-step engineering or knowledge-management task. I am eager to help Notion build the infrastructure that will define the future of agentic search and connected intelligence.

I thrive in high-intensity, "zero-to-one" environments where the goal is to build the "operating system" for human-agent collaboration. I am eager to contribute to Notion’s AI team, building the platforms and tooling that will redefine how the world interacts with information.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
