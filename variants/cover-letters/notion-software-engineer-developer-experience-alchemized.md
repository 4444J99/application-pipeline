Notion is a tool for organizing knowledge. I built a system that organizes 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations through a machine-readable registry, validated dependency graphs, and structured metadata contracts — essentially, a knowledge architecture enforced by code. The problems are the same at different scales: how do you make complex information navigable, how do you keep structure consistent as the system grows, and how do you design APIs that feel intuitive to the people using them.

The system in numbers: 21,000 code files. 3,600+ test files with coverage in 70 of 103 repositories. 94 CI/CD pipelines. 43 validated dependency edges with zero circular dependencies and zero back-edge violations. A single registry-v2.json serves as the source of truth, tracking implementation status, organ membership, and dependency declarations for every repository. Each repository has a seed.yaml metadata contract and a CLAUDE.md developer onboarding document. 810,000+ words of documentation, including 42 published essays totaling 142,000 words.

The documentation-first methodology is central to how I build. I write the CLAUDE.md before I write the implementation. The documentation declares what the system does, what commands to run, what constraints exist, and how the project relates to its neighbors. This is API design thinking applied to every project: the developer's interface with the system is defined first, then the implementation fulfills that contract. 100% documentation coverage across 103 repositories is not aspirational — it is verified by automated checks.

The knowledge architecture goes deeper than documentation. The eight-organ system models domain relationships formally: ORGAN-I (theory) feeds ORGAN-II (art) feeds ORGAN-III (commerce). ORGAN-IV orchestrates all. Dependency edges are declared in seed.yaml, validated weekly by automated scripts, and visualized in a system dashboard. This is the same problem Notion solves for its users — making complex relational knowledge structures navigable and maintainable — implemented as software infrastructure.

TypeScript strict mode across all TypeScript projects. Python with PEP 8 and type hints. CLI tooling built as composable scripts sharing a common library. The application pipeline that produced this cover letter is itself a developer experience tool: 14 Python scripts with consistent interfaces, YAML-based state management, and structured output formats. Developer experience is how I think about every interface I build.

I should be transparent about gaps. My knowledge architecture work is solo — no team collaboration, no external API consumers, no scale-testing with thousands of developers. I have not built developer-facing APIs used by a product's customer base. What I have demonstrated is the architectural thinking that developer experience demands: designing systems where structure is discoverable, documentation is reliable, and the interface between the developer and the system reduces cognitive load rather than adding to it.

Notion's developer experience team shapes how developers interact with Notion's API, integrations, and platform. That work requires someone who thinks about knowledge structure as an engineering problem. I have spent five years doing exactly that.
