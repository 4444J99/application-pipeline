To the S+T+ARTS Prize Jury,

I am submitting **ORGANVM: The Eight-Organ Metasystem** for consideration for the 2026 S+T+ARTS Prize. ORGANVM represents a fundamental shift in digital production, moving beyond art *made* with technology to art that is *composed* of the technological infrastructure itself. It is a live, self-governing corpus encompassing 103 repositories, 21,160 code files, and ~810K+ words of documentation, all coordinated across 8 independent GitHub organizations.

In ORGANVM, the "Art as Catalyst" is the formal orchestration of complex, multi-agent systems to drive human expression at institutional scale. My work is built on the "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive "Cathedral" of systemic logic while ensuring high-signal, scannable "Storefront" entry points for both human reviewers and artificial agents.

My submission addresses the S+T+ARTS nexus through three core innovations:

1. **Innovation in Governance:** ORGANVM is governed by a formal promotion state machine and a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero violations. This is not merely an engineering feat; it is a choreographic score. The performance of the work is the automated validation of the system itself, verified by a corpus of 2,349+ automated tests that act as aesthetic sensors for correctness and integrity.

2. **The AI-Conductor Methodology:** I have pioneered a methodology where human intent directs the volume of 32 specialized AI agent definitions. This shifting of the creative act from discrete production to systemic orchestration is documented across 42 published essays (~142K words). It challenges the boundaries of "collaboration" by treating artificial agency not as a tool, but as a primary member of the creative team.

3. **Production-Grade Creative Infrastructure:** The metasystem is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. This "metabolism" ensures that the artistic corpus remains resilient and steerable as it scales. By applying the rigor of frontier engineering—TypeScript frameworks like `agentic-titan` and 100% schema coverage—to the domain of systems art, I am building the "operating system" for the future of creative production.

ORGANVM responds to the societal challenges of the AI era by demonstrating how we might build steerable, trustworthy, and beautiful systems that amplify rather than replace human imagination. It is an exploration of how the deep logic of science and technology can be reclaimed as a medium for profound artistic inquiry.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
