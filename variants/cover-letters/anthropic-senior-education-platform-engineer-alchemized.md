# Cover Letter: Anthropic Senior Education Platform Engineer

To the Education Platform Engineering Team at Anthropic,

I am writing to apply for the Senior Education Platform Engineer position. My background is uniquely bifurcated: I have spent the last 11 years as a college instructor, teaching 2,000+ students across 8 institutions, while simultaneously spending the last five years building production-grade technical infrastructure as an independent engineer. I am not just a software engineer with an interest in education; I am an educator who builds his own orchestration instruments.

My candidacy is defined by the "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy. I maintain a deep, recursive "Cathedral" of systemic work—103 repositories coordinated across 8 GitHub organizations—while ensuring high-signal, scannability for the AI agents that help manage this scale. This methodology, which I’ve documented in 42 published essays (~142K words), is exactly what is needed to build a learning platform that treats frontier AI not as a feature, but as the foundational architecture.

I bring three core strengths to this role:

1. **Solo Production at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files and 2,349+ automated tests across a validated dependency graph with 43 edges. This architecture is governed by a formal promotion state machine and 94+ independent CI/CD pipelines. I understand how to build robust, enterprise-ready infrastructure that handles significant state and logic, ensuring reliability in high-intensity research environments.

2. **Pedagogical Intuition Grounded in Practice:** Having taught composition and writing for over a decade, I understand the friction points of the learning process. I know that "completion" is not "competence." My teaching practice is grounded in making complex systems accessible, a skill I now apply to building AI-augmented pipelines that translate pedagogical intent into technical architecture.

3. **AI-Native Engineering Discipline:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools, using them as compositional instruments to drive volume through structured human review. I have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for where models excel and where they require engineering safeguards to provide a steerable, trustworthy user experience.

I thrive in fast-paced, high-iteration environments where "Big Science" is the goal. I am eager to help Anthropic define the technical foundation for how enterprises learn at scale, building the pipelines and platform capabilities that enable genuinely new, empowering learning experiences.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
