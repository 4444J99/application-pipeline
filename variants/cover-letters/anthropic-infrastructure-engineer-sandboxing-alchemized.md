To the Sandboxing and Infrastructure Engineering Teams at Anthropic,

I am writing to apply for the Infrastructure Engineer position on the Sandboxing team. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade infrastructure of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a unique "security-as-medium" perspective to isolated execution environments. My work is defined by a "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the researchers—and AI agents—that interact with it.

Anthropic’s mission to build reliable and steerable AI systems requires a sandboxing infrastructure that is both impenetrable and scalable. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale distributed systems orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a deep ownership of operational excellence.

1. **Systems Orchestration and Secure Infrastructure at Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the staff-level challenges of building secure, multi-tenant execution platforms because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional scale as a solo practitioner. My experience with container orchestration and Infrastructure-as-Code is directly applicable to scaling Anthropic’s sandboxed environments to meet growing research demands.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Correctness:** I believe that sandboxing is only as good as the trust it inspires. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that the distributed backend systems and monitoring tools I build for Anthropic will not just be performant, but reliable infrastructure that researchers can trust implicitly for high-stakes evaluations.

3. **AI-Conductor Methodology and Operational Intuition:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for how researchers interact with AI-generated code—specifically how to design observability and debugging tools that make isolated execution transparent and efficient. I have documented this methodology across 42 published essays (~142K words), exploring exactly where technical systems succeed and where reliability gaps create friction.

I thrive in high-intensity, "zero-to-one" environments where the goal is to bridge the gap between frontier research and production-grade engineering rigor. I am eager to contribute to Anthropic’s Sandboxing team, building the secure foundations that will enable Claude to safely interact with the world.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
