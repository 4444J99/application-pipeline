To the DevEx Team at Cursor (Anysphere),

I am writing to apply for the Software Engineer (Developer Experience) position. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade infrastructure of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a deep, firsthand discipline for the "Agent-Human Hybrid" model of software development. My work is defined by a "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the developers—and AI agents—that interact with it.

Cursor’s mission to automate coding by building the best instrument for professional programmers resonates deeply with my own engineering methodology. I don't just use AI tools; I build the infrastructure that makes them reliable at institutional scale. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale systems orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a deep understanding of AI-native developer ergonomics.

1. **Systems Orchestration at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand how to build self-service, resilient platforms because I have architected and owned one from zero to production as a solo practitioner.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Correctness:** I believe that developer experience is founded on system trust. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that developer tooling is not just a collection of scripts, but reliable infrastructure that prevents incidents and tightens feedback loops.

3. **AI-Conductor Methodology:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools, using them as "compositional instruments" to drive solo volume through structured review. I have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for how LLMs fundamentally change the SDLC, and I am eager to help Cursor build the internal systems that will power the future of automated coding.

I thrive in talent-dense, high-intensity environments where the goal is to ship code that defines the frontier. I am eager to contribute to Cursor’s DevEx team, building the tools and workflows that make shipping feel effortless and fast.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
