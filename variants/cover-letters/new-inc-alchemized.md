To the NEW INC Selection Committee,

I am applying for the NEW INC Y12 cohort to incubate **ORGANVM: The Eight-Organ Metasystem**. ORGANVM is a production-grade infrastructure for creative production encompassing 103 repositories, 21,160 code files, and ~810K+ words of documentation, all coordinated across 8 independent GitHub organizations. It is an exploration of how the rigor of frontier engineering can be reclaimed to build resilient, autonomous cultural infrastructure.

My work is built on the "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive "Cathedral" of systemic work while ensuring high-signal, scannable "Storefront" entry points for the agents—both human and artificial—that interact with it.

I bring three core strengths to the NEW INC community:

1. **Solo Production at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 94 active repositories through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero violations. This architecture is governed by a formal promotion state machine and sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows. I have built a system that mirrors the technical scale of a large institution as a solo practitioner, demonstrating a new model for creative agency in the AI era.

2. **The "AI-Conductor" Methodology:** I utilize 32 specialized AI agent definitions as compositional instruments to drive volume through structured review. This methodology, documented across 42 published essays (~142K words), treats AI not as a replacement for the artist, but as a member of a high-performance orchestration team. I am eager to share this "AI-conductor" model with other NEW INC members to explore new forms of collaborative creative labor.

3. **Rigorous Integrity and Correctness:** I believe that cultural infrastructure must be as reliable as the technology it critiques. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my **Classroom RPG Aetheria** project, I’ve implemented AI-native environments with 100% pass rates across unit tests. This discipline ensures that the systems we build to support art are robust, steerable, and future-proof.

NEW INC is the ideal environment to move ORGANVM from a solo "Cathedral" to a public-facing model for creative production. I am eager to collaborate with a community that values the intersection of art, technology, and design to redefine how we build the platforms that will power the next generation of culture.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
