---

I build AI model integrations and explain them to developers. Those two activities — engineering and communication — are usually separate roles. For the Models Engineer, Developer Relations position at Cloudflare, they need to be the same person.

Engineering side: 103 public repositories across 8 GitHub organizations. 21,000 code files. 3,600+ test files. 94 CI/CD pipelines. The most relevant project is agentic-titan, a multi-agent orchestration framework with 1,095 tests across 18 development phases. It coordinates multiple AI model calls through structured task delegation, error handling, and result synthesis — the kind of infrastructure that sits between a developer and the models they want to use. I also built MCP server infrastructure that runs as a local service layer, providing filesystem access, persistent memory, and sequential reasoning capabilities to AI development tools. This is model integration engineering: making AI capabilities accessible through clean interfaces.

Communication side: 810,000+ words of published technical documentation and essays. 42 essays totaling 142,000 words, written as transparent process documentation about building complex software systems. Every one of my 103 repositories has a CLAUDE.md file — a structured onboarding document with architecture notes, build commands, and dependency declarations. I treat documentation as a first-class engineering deliverable because I believe the interface between a model API and the developer using it is primarily a communication problem, not a code problem.

The AI-conductor methodology I developed and documented treats AI models as compositional instruments — the way a producer treats a recording studio. The human provides architectural vision and editorial judgment. The model provides execution capacity. This methodology is documented transparently in the 42 essays, including what works, what fails, and how to recover from model limitations. That kind of honest, practitioner-level documentation is what developers need when they are integrating AI models into their own systems.

Teaching evidence: 11 years teaching 2,000+ university-level students. That experience translates directly to developer relations — explaining complex technical concepts to people at different skill levels, creating learning progressions that build understanding incrementally, and knowing when an explanation has landed versus when it needs a different angle.

I should be direct about scope. I orchestrate LLM APIs and build integration infrastructure — I do not train models or do ML research. My experience is with model consumption, not model development. I have not done developer relations professionally — my communication evidence comes from independent publishing and teaching. What I bring to the Models Engineer role is the rare combination: someone who can build the integration code, write the tutorial, and present the demo, because I have done all three separately at scale.

Cloudflare's developer platform serves millions of developers who want to use AI models at the edge. The models engineer in developer relations bridges the gap between what the models can do and what developers need to understand. That bridge is what I build.
