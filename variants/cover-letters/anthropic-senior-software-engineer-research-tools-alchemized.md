To the Research Tools and AI Research Engineering Teams at Anthropic,

I am writing to apply for the Senior+ Software Engineer position on the Research Tools team. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade infrastructure of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a uniquely rigorous perspective to technical user enablement. My work is defined by a "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the researchers—and AI agents—that interact with it.

Anthropic’s mission to build reliable and steerable AI requires research tools that are equally robust and intuitive. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale full-stack orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a deep understanding of AI-native developer ergonomics.

1. **Systems Orchestration and 0→1 Build Experience:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the staff-level challenges of experiment orchestration and result analysis because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional scale as a solo practitioner. My experience spans the entire stack, from designing high-performance REST APIs to building interactive data visualizations in D3.js and p5.js.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Correctness:** I believe that research tools are only as useful as the trust they inspire. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that the human feedback interfaces and visualization tools I build for Anthropic will not just be functional, but reliable infrastructure that researchers can trust implicitly for high-stakes evaluations.

3. **AI-Conductor Methodology and Prototyping Speed:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for how LLMs can be leveraged to build more powerful tools—specifically how to automate prompt generation and evaluation. I have documented this methodology across 42 published essays (~142K words), exploring where technical systems succeed and where reliability gaps create friction. My ability to rapidly prototype and iterate allows me to move from concept to working research application with unprecedented speed.

I thrive in high-intensity, "zero-to-one" environments where the goal is to build world-class instruments for technical users. I am eager to contribute to Anthropic’s mission, building the research tools that will redefine how the world interacts with information in the AGI era.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
