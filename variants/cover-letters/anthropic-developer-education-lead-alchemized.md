Dear Hiring Team,

11 years teaching complex systems to 2,000+ students. 810,000 words of developer-facing documentation. A gamified education platform that maps curriculum standards to RPG quest mechanics with AI-powered evaluation. I'm applying for the Developer Education Lead role because I've spent my career doing the two things this role demands simultaneously: building developer tools and teaching people how complex systems work.

Classroom RPG: Aetheria is the most direct proof. It's a React 19/TypeScript education platform I built that transforms classroom learning into game mechanics — quests mapped to CCSS ELA and AP Literature standards, an eight-tier XP progression system, AI-generated rubric scoring with remediation feedback, and an educator analytics dashboard tracking mastery by standard. Four thematic skins. A four-year English Literature curriculum shipped out of the box. Three-way student/teacher/parent voting for personalized learning paths. This is developer education as product: taking a pedagogical insight (progression loops sustain engagement better than isolated assignments) and building the infrastructure to deliver it.

The content pipeline you're describing — idea to validation to production to launch — is a system I've already built. My application-pipeline manages 66 targets through a state machine with automated validation, an 8-dimension scoring rubric, preflight checks, and conversion tracking. I built it because ad-hoc prioritization doesn't scale, and measurement matters more than intuition. The same discipline applies to developer education content: what gets made, when, for whom, and whether it actually produces fluency.

I use Claude daily as core infrastructure. My AI-conductor methodology — human directs architecture, AI generates at scale, human reviews — produced 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations: 21K code files, 3.6K tests, 94 CI/CD pipelines, all governed by CLAUDE.md onboarding documents (100% coverage). The 42 published essays documenting this methodology are themselves developer education content. They teach the approach by showing it working in real time, including the failures and course corrections.

What I'd bring to Anthropic's Ministry of Education: a technical builder who creates and tests dev tools daily (Claude Code, Claude Agent SDK, Greenhouse API integrations, CLI tooling suites). An educator with 100+ courses of experience knowing how people actually learn complex systems — scaffolded difficulty, iterative feedback, visible progression. And a content strategist who builds measurement systems rather than relying on vibes. The gap between what Claude can do and what developers know how to build with it is an education problem. I'm an educator who builds with Claude every day.

Based in New York City, open to 25% in-office, available to start immediately.
