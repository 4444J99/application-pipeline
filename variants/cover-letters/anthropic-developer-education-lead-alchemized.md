Dear Hiring Team,

810,000 words of developer-facing documentation, 42 published essays, and 103 repositories — all produced by one person using Claude as a compositional instrument. I'm applying for the Developer Education Lead role because I've already been doing the work this role describes: building a content pipeline that moves from idea to production, measuring what works, and iterating at the speed capabilities evolve.

For the past 11 years, I taught complex systems to 2,000+ students across 8 institutions — composition, creative writing, and literature courses where the core challenge was always the same: take something abstract and make it learnable without dumbing it down. That pedagogical instinct now drives how I build technical documentation. Every one of my 103 repositories ships with a CLAUDE.md file — a structured onboarding document that gives developers (and AI agents) the context they need to work effectively. 100% coverage, maintained across every repo.

The content pipeline I've built mirrors what you're describing for this role. My application-pipeline system manages 63+ targets through a state machine (research → qualified → drafting → staged → submitted → outcome), with automated validation, preflight checks, and conversion tracking. The alchemize.py orchestrator takes a Greenhouse job posting, maps identity blocks to requirements, generates synthesis prompts, and produces portal-ready submissions — the same idea-to-validation-to-production-to-launch workflow you need for developer education content. I built this because ad-hoc, vibes-based prioritization doesn't scale. You're looking for someone who agrees.

I use Claude extensively in my daily work — not as a novelty, but as core infrastructure. My AI-conductor methodology treats AI tools the way Brian Eno treated the recording studio: the human provides architectural vision and editorial judgment; AI provides execution capacity at scale. This approach enabled a single operator to produce 21,160 code files, 3,610 test files, and 94 CI/CD pipelines across 8 GitHub organizations. The 42 essays documenting this methodology are themselves developer education content — they teach the approach by showing it in action, including the failures and course corrections.

What I'd bring to Anthropic's Ministry of Education: the rare combination of a technical builder who can create and test dev tools independently, an experienced educator who knows how people learn complex systems, and a content strategist who builds measurement systems rather than relying on intuition. I've owned content roadmaps end-to-end — from curriculum design through delivery through outcome measurement — across 100+ courses. The scale is different at Anthropic, but the discipline transfers directly.

I'm based in New York City, open to 25% in-office, and available to start immediately.
