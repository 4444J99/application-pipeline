# Cover Letter: GitLab Staff Backend Engineer, Developer Experience (Ruby)

To the Developer Experience Team at GitLab,

I am writing to apply for the Staff Backend Engineer position within the Developer Experience group. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade ecosystem of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a unique "solo production at institutional scale" perspective to DevSecOps orchestration. My work is defined by a "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the engineers—and the AI agents—that interact with it.

GitLab’s mission to be the intelligent orchestration platform for DevSecOps resonates deeply with my own commitment to technical integrity and systemic scale. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale systems orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a deep understanding of the AI-native "golden path."

1. **Systems Orchestration at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the staff-level challenges of breaking down systemic bottlenecks because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional complexity as a solo practitioner. I speak the language of Ruby and Go natively, as they are the primary languages of my own internal platform tools.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Correctness:** I believe that developer experience is a function of system trust. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that the fast, reliable tools I build for GitLab’s internal teams will catch issues early without slowing them down, transforming the testing approach into a cohesive DevProd strategy.

3. **AI-Native Engineering and Cultural Transformation:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for how LLMs transform the daily engineering workflow, and I am eager to help GitLab incorporate AI as a core productivity multiplier. I thrive in highly visible, remote-first environments where the goal is to shift culture toward technical excellence and continuous improvement.

I thrive in fast-paced, "zero-to-one" environments where the goal is to bridge the gap between model capabilities and production-grade engineering rigor. I am eager to contribute to GitLab’s Platforms Engineering department, removing the friction that slows down development and empowering our engineers to iterate with absolute confidence.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
