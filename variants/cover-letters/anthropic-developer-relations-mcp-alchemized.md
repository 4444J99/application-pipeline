Dear Hiring Team,

I use MCP every day. My development environment runs 7 MCP servers — filesystem, memory graph, sequential thinking, GitHub, Docker tools, Neon database, and Jupyter — configured across a 103-repository system spanning 8 GitHub organizations. When I applied to this role, the application itself was processed through MCP-connected tools. I'm applying for Developer Relations, MCP because I've been living inside the protocol's developer experience since it launched.

My AI-conductor methodology — one human architect directing AI coding agents through MCP-enabled toolchains — produced 21,160 code files, 3,610 test files, and 94 CI/CD pipelines. The methodology depends on MCP: every repository ships with a CLAUDE.md file that configures how AI agents interact with the codebase, and MCP servers provide the external tool access that makes agents useful beyond text generation. I've built and maintained MCP server configurations, debugged transport layer issues, and designed workflows that coordinate multiple MCP tools in sequence.

The technical infrastructure I've built demonstrates hands-on MCP proficiency. agent--claude-smith is a multi-agent system built on the Claude Agent SDK with session persistence, self-correction hooks, and Zod schema validation. agentic-titan is a multi-agent orchestration framework with 1,095 tests covering agent coordination, message passing, and fault tolerance. These systems consume MCP tools as their interface to external systems — exactly the pattern the broader developer ecosystem needs to adopt.

Before building with AI tools, I spent 11 years teaching complex systems to 2,000+ students across 8 institutions. Developer relations is education at scale, and I bring that pedagogical instinct to content creation: 42 published essays (142K words) document the AI-conductor methodology in real time, teaching by showing the process including failures. My portfolio site uses p5.js generative art and is built with Astro — I create technical content, not just strategy.

What I'd bring to MCP DevRel specifically: practitioner credibility from daily MCP usage, the ability to create sample apps and integration guides from direct experience, a deep understanding of where developers get stuck with the protocol (server configuration, transport debugging, tool schema design, multi-server coordination), and the communication skills from 11 years of classroom teaching. I understand open source community dynamics — my entire 103-repo system is public, with governance structures designed for community contribution.

I'm based in New York City, open to relocation for this role, and available to start immediately.
