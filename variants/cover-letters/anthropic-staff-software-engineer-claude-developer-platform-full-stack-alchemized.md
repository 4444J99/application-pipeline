To the Claude Developer Platform and Product Foundations Teams at Anthropic,

I am writing to apply for the Staff Software Engineer (Full Stack) position on the Claude Developer Platform team. As an independent engineer who has spent the last five years building a production-grade infrastructure of 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, I bring a uniquely rigorous perspective to developer experience. My work is defined by a "Cathedral → Storefront" philosophy: maintaining a deep, recursive systemic architecture while ensuring high-signal, scannable entry points for the developers—and AI agents—that interact with it.

Anthropic’s mission to build reliable and steerable AI requires a developer platform that is equally empowering and intuitive. My candidacy is built on three core pillars: large-scale full-stack systems orchestration, a rigorous testing culture, and a deep understanding of AI-native developer ergonomics.

1. **Systems Orchestration at Institutional Scale:** I currently manage 21,160 code files coordinated through automated governance, including a validated dependency graph with 43 edges and zero back-edge violations. This architecture is sustained by 128 GitHub Actions workflows built on 18 reusable templates. I understand the staff-level challenges of building "0→1" products because I have architected and owned a system that mirrors institutional scale as a solo practitioner. My experience spans the entire stack, from designing robust REST APIs to building high-performance, accessible frontends in React and Next.js.

2. **Rigorous Testing and Correctness:** I believe that developer trust is the primary differentiatior for any API platform. My current corpus includes 2,349+ automated tests across 94 active repositories, with 100% coverage of core configuration schemas. In my `recursive-engine` project, I maintain 1,254 tests reaching 85% coverage. This discipline ensures that the tools I build to help developers bring their applications to production—such as prompt evaluation frameworks and deployment pipelines—are as reliable as they are fast.

3. **AI-Conductor Methodology and Claude Integration:** I am a power user of agentic coding tools and have built multi-agent orchestration frameworks (like `agentic-titan`) and reliability layers for the Claude Agent SDK. I bring a deep intuition for how Claude can be leveraged to improve its own API usage—specifically how to design interfaces that help users maximize model capabilities through automated prompt generation and evaluation. I have documented this methodology across 42 published essays (~142K words), exploring where technical systems succeed and where reliability gaps create friction.

I thrive in high-intensity, product-focused environments where the goal is to build world-class instruments for professional developers. I am eager to contribute to Anthropic’s mission, building the platforms and tooling that will redefine software engineering for the AGI era.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Anthony James Padavano
